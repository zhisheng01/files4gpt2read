I'LL USE THIS AS AN EXAMPLE AND THEY CHOOSE TO DO THIS
SO YOU WOULD ALSO BE PREPARED TO POSSIBLY HAVE COMBO CLASSES IT JUST KIND OF DEPENDS ON
THE STORY WAS RECORDED IN THE BOOK THE SHIP AND THE STORM BY JIM CARRIER
ALTHOUGH MANY MODELS AROUND THE WORLD SERVE AS SOURCES
AND THEN THEY WILL GO THROUGH A SELECTION PROCESS TO SELECT THE TEACHERS FOR THE SCHOOL
GERMAN SCIENTISTS DEVELOP ZEOLITE THERMAL STORAGE PELLETS THAT CAN STORE FOUR TIMES AS MUCH THERMAL ENERGY AS WATER AND CAN RETAIN THEIR ENERGY ALMOST INDEFINITELY
WHAT IS THE DAILY SANITATION PLAN BEYOND SIMPLY SANITIZING DURING THE SUMMER
THE CONSULTANT HAS RUN THE AMORTIZATION OF THE DEBTS
MY ZONE
WE'RE GONNA DIVIDE IT BY THE NUMBER OF AGES WELL WE HAVE SIX AGES HERE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX
THIS IS A CONCERN FOR DUAL WORKING PARENTS AND DEFINITELY SINGLE PARENTS THAT ARE STILL WORKING
SOCIAL WORKERS
THAT THE PRINCIPAL OF THE VIRTUAL SCHOOL K TWELVE WILL BE MIKE SCIACCA
THE EUROPEAN EXTREMELY LARGE TELESCOPE IS APPROVED FOR CONSTRUCTION BY MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN SOUTHERN OBSERVATORY ORGANIZATION
OR POTENTIALLY SKIPPING COURSES IN SEQUENCING
I DO NOT HAVE THE ANSWER ON HOW TO DO THIS BUT I KNOW IT WOULD BE WRONG TO DO SO
BUT BEFORE WE LOOK AT THE HARDWARE SUPPORT THEY USE
IF IT CAN GO BOTH WAYS
THE PLAN TO REOPEN SCHOOLS IS TOO AGGRESSIVE
RESEARCHERS IN THE US PRODUCE THE SHORTEST-EVER LASER PULSES WITH A DURATION OF SIXTY SEVEN ATTOSECONDS
IF WE WANT KIDS ON CAMPUS ALL DAY
BUT TO ME
CLEARLY BY THE DECISION MADE LAST EVENING AT THE BOARD MEETING YOU DON'T
SCIENTISTS REPORT THAT A NEW GENETIC TEST COULD DIAGNOSE THE RISK OF BREAST CANCER YEARS BEFORE THE DISEASE ACTUALLY DEVELOPS ALLOWING MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE EARLY TREATMENT
MIT ENGINEERS DEVELOP A HEARING AID BATTERY WHICH USES IONS WITHIN THE HUMAN INNER EAR TO PROVIDE A STEADY ELECTRIC CURRENT
THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DAMAGE IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT
AND AGAIN OUR PLAN FOR JANUARY IS TO TALK ABOUT KANSAS
WILL THE SCHOOL PROVIDE COUNSELING FOR EMOTIONAL EFFECTS TO STUDENTS IF A STUDENT BRINGS HOME COVID NINETEEN TO A PARENT OR GRANDPARENT AND THAT GUARDIAN CONSEQUENTLY DIES FROM COVID NINETEEN
YOU'RE FORWARD THINKING YOU FOCUS ON KIDS
I REALLY MESSED UP AND YOU SAID I DOUBT IT
THEY ARE NOT AT RISK NOR ARE THE TEACHERS I AM NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF EDUCATION MY CHILDREN HAVE RECEIVED THESE PAST FEW MONTHS
BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE THE KEY INFORMATION IN THERE SO PARENTS CAN MAKE AN EDUCATED DECISION
ONE IS IN REGARDS TO OUR FAMILIES AND SENDING OUT THE SURVEY
AS ARCTIC ICE COVER REDUCES DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE THE ARCTIC SEA ROUTE MAY BECOME INCREASINGLY VIABLE FOR LARGE SHIPS
OR ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU MULTIPLY BOTH SIDES TIMES THE NUMBER OF AGES
THERE'S A
OKAY
YES
ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION
NOT JUST BECAUSE OF DANGERS TO THEM
STUDENTS WOULD BE INVOLVED IN SOME SORT OF ON CAMPUS EXTENDED LEARNING
WE HAVE VERY HIGH QUALITY NEANDERTHAL GENOME SO YOU CAN LOOK AT DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THIS ALSO YOU CAN LOOK FOR EXAMPLE ON HETEROZYGOSITY SO HOW MUCH VARIATION THERE IS BETWEEN THE TWO VERSIONS OF THE GENOME THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL INHERITED FROM THE FATHER AND THE MOTHER
AND YOU'VE ALSO LET THEM RUN THEIR DEPARTMENTS AND BE THEIR BEST THAT THEY CAN BE AND YOU PUSH THEM A LITTLE BIT YOU'VE CHALLENGED THEM A LITTLE BIT
SO I AM GOING TO GO BACK TO THE ALPHABETICAL INDEX AND I AM GOING TO LOOK UP ABSENT
BUT WE'RE SHARING
HAVE MORE CLASSES COMING IT'S A REALLY EXCITING TIME
WE HAVE THE LUXURY OF A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME NOT MUCH
AND WHAT I WILL FOCUS ON ARE THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE GENOMES OF NEANDERTHALS AND PRESENT DAY HUMANS
OKAY IF THEY CHOOSE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK PARENTS WANT TO KNOW AND PARENTS WILL BE MORE
I ALSO HAVE SOME PHONE CALLS THAT WE RECEIVED FROM PARENTS BECAUSE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS DR NAVARRO STARTED WAS TARDY SWEEP BECAUSE WE HAD AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS AT THAT TIME AT COSTA MESA NOT SHOWING UP
BUT WE WILL SPEND OUR TIME ON ELEMENTARY THIS EVENING
RESEARCHERS HAVE SHOWN FOR THE FIRST TIME THE TRAPPING ACTION OF THE PIMPERNEL SUNDEW DROSERA GLANDULIGERA A CARNIVOROUS PLANT
THE OTHER TRADE OFF IS HOME TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION
THAT'S WHERE EVERYBODY GOES TO WORK TO FINALIZE THOSE PROCEDURES
WE WANT THE OPTION AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOU ADVOCATE FOR STUDENTS LIKE MY DAUGHTER
A NEW STUDY SHOWS THAT WITH NEAR PERFECT SENSITIVITY
SINCE DEVELOPING A METHOD OF ISOLATING AND SEQUENCING THE DNA OF LONG-EXTINCT SPECIES
MY COMMUNITY MEMBER IS DARRYL OLIVER
GOING WAY UP
AFTER MOVING ACROSS MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN IN CENTRAL AMERICA THE SURFACE CIRCULATION OF MITCH DISSIPATED ON NOVEMBER ONE
AND SO I JUST WANNA ASSURE THE PUBLIC THAT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY WORKING NONSTOP TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS AND THEN TO COMMUNICATE THEM OUT AS APPROPRIATE
UNLESS WE WERE FRENCH WHICH HAS NO SCHOOL ON WEDNESDAYS EVER
BUT WE NEED TO PROVIDE EDUCATION FOR THEM ON WEDNESDAYS
THE BOYS STARTED TO LAUGH A LITTLE WHICH MADE THE COACH EVEN MATTER
BECAUSE AS A SINGLE PARENT I AM WORRIED ABOUT SENDING HER BACK TO SCHOOL WITHOUT A VACCINE IT'S JUST NOT WORTH THE RISK
IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO ONE DAY CREATE AN UNLIMITED SUPPLY OF HUMAN EGGS TO AID FERTILITY TREATMENT US DOCTORS SAY
SO WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED
BUT PLEASE TAKE A LONG TERM VIEW ON REOPENING AND HOW THIS MAY IMPACT OUR DISTRICT FOR YEARS TO COME
THE PARKS ARE PACKED PLEASE OPEN FIVE FULL DAYS
YOU CAN OF COURSE FOR MOST PART OF IT NOT MAKE SENSE OF IT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE THINGS
IF THE CONDITIONS GOT BETTER
RES
YES SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IMAGE IT'S OF COURSE DIFFERENT WITH THE NEANDERTHALS BECAUSE THIS HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO AND THESE FRAGMENTS ARE SORT OF SPREAD ALL OVER THE GENOME AND IT'S NOW IS SOME KIND OF EQUILIBRIUM WE ALL HAVE IT SO IT'S NOT DECREASING ANYMORE
CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE FORM OF REDUCED SNOWFALL IN MOUNTAINS IS HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT ON MOUNTAINOUS PLANT AND BIRD COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE INCREASED ABILITY OF ELK TO STAY AT HIGH ELEVATIONS OVER WINTER AND CONSUME PLANTS ACCORDING TO A STUDY IN NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
THE BREAST CANCER WAS PREVIOUSLY EXCISED WITH NO FURTHER TREATMENT DIRECTED AT THAT SITE
AND THAT IS ONLY BECAUSE
AND THEN YOU DO A WRITE LATER
ICE SHEET LOSS AT BOTH POLES IS INCREASING THE STUDY FINDS
SO PLEASE LET US HAVE OUR SCHOOL SOCIAL BUBBLES EVEN IF IT'S JUST FOR HALF A DAY
WE RECOGNIZE YOU'RE IN A VERY TOUGH SPOT AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY
BUT INSTEAD TO SOMEHOW LOOK AT THE INSTRUCTIONS AHEAD OF TIME AND DECIDE THAT THERE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE SAFE TO EXECUTE
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S
PAUL KURTZ AMERICAN SKEPTIC PHILOSOPHER AND SECULAR HUMANIST B
SO I AM GOING TO GO BACK TO MY ALPHABETICAL INDEX
IT WOULD CREATE A TON OF SOCIAL DISTANCING FLEXIBILITY TO ALL BUT GUARANTEE SUCCESSFUL OPENING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR
WHICH IN TURN OPENED THE DOOR TO A WORLD OF OPPORTUNITY
OH I'M SORRY
TRUSTEE SNELL
WE ARE GOING TO USE THE MALIGNANT SECONDARY COLUMN
WHAT ABOUT WHEN A TEACHER'S SPOUSE TESTS POSITIVE AND THEY QUARANTINE FOR TWO WEEKS
ANY OTHER REASONS
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY ADVOCATE FOR SCHOOLS TO REOPEN WITH NO MASKS
WHAT ABOUT KIDS IN SPORTS OR OTHER EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES
AS ANDREW WAS TALKING ABOUT LIKE COURSERA
EVEN TO AREAS WHERE THEY HADN'T BEEN NEANDERTHALS
COMMENT
THIS DEVELOPMENT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS AGO LATER GRANTED HUMANS THE ABILITY TO LEARN COMPLEX SKILLS ANALYSE SITUATIONS AND THINK FLEXIBLY
THIS IS NOT POLITICAL THIS IS A HEALTH CONCERN
IF OUR MEMBERS ARE ABLE TO COMPLETE WORK REMOTELY WILL THEY BE ALLOWED TO DO SO

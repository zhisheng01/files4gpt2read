369.AND THAT GOES FOR TONS OF ADDICTIONS
370.AND THAT I COULD START TO HEAL NOW
371.AND THAT IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER IN TERMS OF EMOTIONAL GROWTH

725.BUT STARVING YOURSELF ISN'T SOMETHING YOU CAN MAINTAIN
726.BUT THAT SHE COULD NOT FACE THE FACT

748.BUT WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS AND THAT'S PART OF THE GENETICS THAT MAKE US UP IS THAT
749.BUT WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT
750.BUT WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO

1642.IN THE LOST AND FOUND BIN
1643.IN THE MOMENT I FELT FOR PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE
1644.IN THE ROYCE WHITE EPISODE THAT WAS A LIVE EPISODE WE DID THERE WAS
1645.IN THE WINTER IN THE MOUNTAINS ABOVE THE TREE LINE

1659.I RAN OUT OF MY BEDROOM GRABBED TWO HANDFULS OF ICE CUBES FROM THE FREEZER AND BEGAN RUBBING THEM ON MY FACE STOMACH AND LEGS
1660.I REALIZED RIGHT THEN THAT ALL THE DREAMS I EVER HAD OF MATTERING TO HIM AND BEING DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL WERE JUST NOT EVER GOING TO BE REALITY
1661.I REALIZED THAT HOWEVER INAPPROPRIATE IT MAY BE
1662.I REALIZED THAT I HAD ESCAPED
1663.I REALIZE THAT SOME ADDICTS ARE PRONE TO EXPLOITING MANIPULATING AND ABUSING OTHER PEOPLE BUT SOME ARE JUST SELF-DESTRUCTING IN A WAY THAT'S FAR MORE IMPLOSIVE THAN EXPLOSIVE

1691.I SAW THAT IN HIM AND THAT'S PART OF WHY I REACHED OUT TO HIM JOHN B MCLEMORE'S EDUCATION IS THE SOURCE OF SOME GOSSIP IN WOODSTOCK
1692.IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU CAN PHYSICALLY SEE ON THE SCREEN

1717.I STARTED TO START HAVING FEELINGS AND DESIRES TO SWERVE MY LITTLE CAR UNDERNEATH THE TRACTOR-TRAILER ON THE HIGHWAY AND I WAS FRIGHTENED BY HOW MUCH I DID NOT FEEL OR CARE HOW MUCH THIS WOULD HURT MY LOVED ONES EVEN WHEN I KNEW IT WAS NOT A SOLUTION
1718.IS THAT SOMEBODY WHO WAS RAISED IN THAT KIND OF ABUSE

1729.I STOPPED REALLY COMMUNICATING WITH PEOPLE
1730.I STOPPED STARING UP AT THE SKY FEELING THE RAINDROPS HITTING MY SKIN
1731.I SUPPOSE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO FOCUS
1732.IS WHAT HOW THE PERSON JUSTIFIES IT TO THEMSELVES WHAT THEY SAY
1733.IS WHAT WE CALL THE PROVERBIAL ROCK BOTTOM
1734.IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO REPEAT AS AN ADULT BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT IT'S COMPLETELY NORMAL
1735.IS YOU KNOW I WANT TO BE THAT PERSON THAT GETS RID OF THEIR SHAME
1736.I TALKED ABOUT HOW I NEED A BIGGER BUDGET FOR THE PODCAST EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND EUROS
1737.I TALK TO MYSELF ALL THE TIME WHAT DO YOU SAY
1738.IT CERTAINLY ISN'T EVERYTHING I HAVE TO SAY BUT IT'S PROBABLY ENOUGH YOU AND YOUR PODCAST ARE A WONDERFUL COMFORT TO ME THANK YOU SO MUCH JAN THAT IS
1739.IT DID BRING ME A LOT OF COMFORT I THOUGHT THAT WAS AWESOME BECAUSE IT WAS
1740.IT DISTURBED ALLEN NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT CAUSED HIM TO MISS HIS FRIEND'S FUNERAL
1741.IT DOES AMAZING THINGS FOR ME EVERY DAY BUT I KEEP PUNISHING IT WITH FOOD AND LACK OF ACTIVITY
1742.IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD UNTIL I COMPLETELY BURN OUT YOU KNOW
1743.IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT RESONATES WITH WHO I AM I'M A WOMAN
1744.IT DOESN'T GET WORSE THAN THAT IN MY OPINION AND I WOULD AGREE
1745.I TELL HER I DON'T THINK THAT'S ALL THAT STRANGE
1746.I TELL HER I'M SORRY FOR HER LOSS
1747.I TELL HER THAT ACCORDING TO EVERYONE I'VE SPOKEN TO THAT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE THE CASE
1748.IT GETS EASIERTHAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL
1749.IT GOT UGLY IN HEARING HE WRITES
1750.IT HAS A COPY OF THE GRADUATING
1751.IT HAS HELPED ME NOT TO FIND IT SO ALIEN TO HEAR SWEARING AND IT NO LONGER BOTHERS ME ANYWHERE NEAR AS MUCH TO HEAR PEOPLE SWEAR
1752.I THEN BARKED ONCE AND SPRINTED BACK TO THE SAFETY OF MY AUNT'S HOME
1753.I THINK ABOUT HALF OF THE WORK I DO LIKE THE WORK
1754.I THINK ABOUT KILLING MYSELF A LOT OR JUST RUNNING AWAY AND CUTTING TIES WITH MY FAMILY
1755.I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO HAVING THOSE KIND OF INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS AND I HOPE YOU DON'T JUDGE YOURSELF FOR THAT
1756.I THINK A WORSE PROBLEM IS SORT OF COMFORT IN MY OWN SKIN IF THAT MAKES SENSE
1757.I THINK BECAUSE I WISH THAT I HAD THE ABILITY TO COME LIKE THAT
1758.I THINK DBT DIALECTICAL BEHAVIORAL THERAPY WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO HELP GET
1759.I THINK EVERYONE DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE AND I SAID I AGREE
1760.I THINK I DO OKAY BEING COMFORTABLE WITH UNRESOLVED PROBLEMS AND FEELING PEACE
1761.I THINK I JUST GOT OUT OF SURVIVAL MODE LIKE THIS YEAR
1762.I THINK I'LL BE ABLE TO LET MY FRIENDS KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THEY ARE TO ME IN THE NEAR FUTURE I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL EVER BE ABLE TO LET MY PARENTS KNOW THAT I'D RATHER NOT SPEND TIME WITH THEM
1763.I THINK I PRONOUNCED THAT RIGHT
1764.I THINK I SAID MAYBE A COUPLE EPISODES AGO
1765.I THINK IT FUELED MY FANTASIES ABOUT BEING SEXUALLY SUBMISSIVE TO SOMEONE
1766.I THINK IT'S A SHAME MY FAMILY DIDN'T GET ONE WAY EARLIER
1767.I THINK IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE THE BOND THAT WE WERE BOTH USED
1768.I THINK IT WOULD SHOW PEOPLE THAT IT'S OK IF THEY HAD ALRIGHT UPBRINGINGS BUT ARE STILL STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH THAT DISCUSSION POINT OF GIVING YOURSELF PERMISSION TO FEEL MESSED UP EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE SOMETHING HORRIBLE HAPPEN TO YOU
1769.I THINK I'VE SAID IT BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST
1770.I THINK I WAS SO TIRED YESTERDAY I WENT TO GO GET SOMETHING TO EAT
1771.I THINK I WOULD BE REMISS
1772.I THINK JUST THE OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO READ TO WRITE YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT LIFE YOU KNOW FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY YEAR OLD MEN YOU KNOW WHO CAN ACTUALLY TEACH ME SOMETHING
1773.I THINK MAYBE HE'S NOT SURE WHAT I KNOW ALREADY OR ELSE MAYBE HE KNOWS I KNOW SO HE KNOWS HE DOESN'T HAVE TO SAY IT OUT LOUD
1774.I THINK MAYBE SHE'S NOT SURE WHAT I KNOW ALREADY
1775.I THINK SHE MEANS IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A HORRIBLE EXCEPT THE BIGGER PAIR WAS FALLING OFF
1776.I THINK SO WELL YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT LIVE WITH BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER
1777.I THINK THAT I FEEL IT LESS THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
1778.I THINK THAT IF I WOULD EVER GET SICK IN PUBLIC I WILL KILL MYSELF
1779.I THINK THAT NOT MUCH GOES THROUGH MY HEAD AT THAT POINT
1780.I THINK THAT OTHER THINGS MAY HAVE HAPPENED BETWEEN MY FATHER AND I BUT I WAS SO YOUNG THAT I'M JUST NOT SURE I FEEL LIKE I MAY HAVE BLOCKED OUT MEMORIES FROM THAT TIME IN MY LIFE
1781.I THINK THAT'S THE COOLEST THING ABOUT BEING A MOM IN RECOVERY IS TO HAVE A CLUE WHAT THE HANDBOOK TO LIFE IS AND ACTUALLY BE TEACHING SOME OF THAT STUFF
1782.I THINK THE HUMAN CAPACITY FOR COMPARTMENTALIZATION IS LARGE AND THIS IS A CASE WHERE IT WAS IN FULL BLAST MODE
1783.I THINK THE ONLY WAY TO SOOTHE MYSELF IS READING MORE SURVEYS
1784.I THINK THERE ARE MONSTERS OUT THERE
1785.I THINK THERE'S LESSONS YOU KNOW THAT WE CAN ALL LEARN FROM
1786.I THINK THERE WAS ANOTHER PERSON IN HERE
1787.I THINK THEY KNEW THAT THESE PEOPLE
1788.I THINK VERY OFTEN ABOUT HAVING CASUAL SEX WITH SOMEONE I FEEL SAFE WITH
1789.I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHAT HOLDING THAT SHAME IN FEELS LIKE IT FEELS SAFE BUT SLOWLY MAN IT JUST DRAGS US DOWN
1790.I THINK WE THINK ABOUT THOSE LITTLE MOMENTS
1791.I THINK WHEN I STARTED TO GET OVER THE SHAKING AND CRYING IN THE RING AND I STARTED TO BE PRESENT
1792.I THINK YOU ARE WHAT YOU PRACTICE I DON'T PRACTICE SEXUAL DEVIANCE ANYMORE
1793.I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A KEY THAT I'M GONNA SHRED
1794.I THOUGHT I DIDN'T WANT LONG HAIR NO MY MOTHER DIDN'T WANT ME TO HAVE LONG HAIR
1795.I THOUGHT I HATED PURPLE NO MY MOTHER HATED PURPLE I THOUGHT I HATED WEARING DRESSES NO MY MOTHER HATED PUTTING ME IN DRESSES
1796.I THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN THROUGH TO GET TO THIS POINT WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL AT SOME POINT I MUST HAVE STOPPED SEEING A FUTURE FOR MYSELF
1797.I THOUGHT WE WOULD GO BACK HOME BUT IT DID NOT HAPPEN JUST MORE BEATINGS FOR HER I BECAME INVISIBLE
1798.I THREW A BAG OF MY SIBLINGS' TOYS OUT OF FRUSTRATION AND THEY WENT EVERYWHERE
1799.IT IS CRAZY THE THINGS THAT
1800.IT IS NOT THIS LEFT I'M HAVING A HEART ATTACK IT IS THE NEXT LEFT
1801.IT IS NOT YOUR CHOICE TO HANG ON TO IT THAT IS THERE BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT TRAUMA DOES AND SO DO NOT SHAME YOURSELF FOR STILL HAVING THOSE FEELINGS
1802.IT IS SO HARD TO UNLEARN WANTING TO SAVE OTHER PEOPLE OR WANTING TO CHANGE THE MOOD OF A ROOM
1803.IT IT WAS JUST LIKE THIS
1804.IT JUST MAKES ME SO INCREDIBLY SAD
1805.IT JUST REALLY REALLY TOUCHES ME THAT YOU
1806.IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS DESIGNED BY LIZA MINNELLI LIKE IT CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THE SPOTLIGHT
1807.IT MADE ME WANT TO BE VEGAN
1808.IT MAKES A PERSON FEEL GOOD
1809.IT MAKES IT REALLY HARD TO SEPARATE THE ABUSE AND THE LOVE
1810.IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE MAYBE I'M NOT ALIVE ENOUGH TO HAVE ANYTHING
1811.IT NEVER FELT WEIRD BECAUSE SHE WAS INTO THE SAME STUFF
1812.IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE SYSTEMIC DENIAL OF OUR FAMILY'S ISSUES WAS A HUGE PART OF THE PROBLEM AND THAT I COULD HELP IT TO CONTINUE BY REMAINING SILENT OR I COULD BUCK THE SYSTEM SO I BUCKED
1813.I TOLD A FRIEND OR TWO ABOUT HER ONCE I WAS AN ADULT BUT NEVER AS A KID OR TEEN
1814.I TOLD HIM WE HAD A LITTLE PROBLEM
1815.I TOLD HIM WHAT WAS SAID AND I'LL NEVER FORGET JOEL'S FACE HE'S SUCH A SOLID GUY HE SAID DO YOU WANT ME TO HAVE TYSON TAKE HIS GEAR OFF
1816.I TOLD THEM WHERE I WAS
1817.IT ONLY JUST THEN DAWNED ON ME HOW PERVERSE THAT WAS AND YEARS LATER HOW IT AFFECTED MY SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT
1818.I TOOK A BUNCH OF BENADRYL
1819.I TOOK OUT EVERY BIT OF RAGE
1820.I TOOK THEM TOOK A SHOWER DOWNLOADED AN APP TO REMIND ME TO TAKE THEM AT THE SAME TIME AND THEN EMAILED MY PARENTS TO SAY I WAS OK
1821.IT OWNS ME THE FIRST SECOND IT
1822.IT QUICKLY BECAME NOT ABOUT THAT
1823.IT REALLY MADE ME THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF PERSON I WANTED TO BE
1824.I TREATED THAT LITTLE BEAD LIKE A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY
1825.I TRIED TO KEEP UP WITH THE CONVERSATION
1826.I TRY TO BE THE OPPOSITE OF HOW I WAS RAISED AND I'M SO SCARED OF HER HAVING EVEN A SINGLE SAD MOMENT IN HER LIFE
1827.I TRY TO TELL MYSELF THAT
1828.IT'S A LIST JOHN WROTE ON A SHEET OF YELLOW NOTEBOOK PAPER TITLED AT THE TOP PEOPLE TO CONTACT
1829.IT'S ALSO ABOUT MUSIC AS THERAPY AND EAR HUSTLERS MIGHT RECOGNIZE THE GUY TALKING
1830.IT'S A MENTAL BLANK SPOT IT'S LIKE
1831.IT'S A NIGHTMARE THAT LEAVES ME FEELING COMPLETELY AWFUL AND I WORRY DEEPLY ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES FOR MY SON
1832.IT'S APRIL NOW IT'S GOTTA BE COMING UP ON THE TIME MY GRANDMOTHER DIED AND MY PHONE RINGS
1833.IT'S BEEN A COUPLE OF YEARS SINCE I WAS ABLE TO GET COUNSELING BECAUSE I LOST MY JOB
1834.IT'S BEEN FEATURED ON FORBES WALL STREET JOURNAL TIME MAGAZINE NEW YORK TIMES
1835.IT'S EASIER TO JUST WRITE A NOTE AND THEN PUT IT INSIDE A LITTLE CURRENT
1836.IT SEEMS LIKE I CAN FEEL MILD GUILT SHAME ETCETERA
1837.IT'S FROM A GUY NAMED REMUS SAM LANGI REMUS IS IN PRISON FOR MURDER
1838.IT'S FUNNY WHEN I READ THESE TO MYSELF AS I PUT THE SURVEYS TOGETHER TO DO THE SHOW
1839.IT'S GOING TO FEEL SO MUCH BETTER TO YOU THAN IT DOES TO SOMEBODY WHO FEELS GOOD ALL THE TIME
1840.IT'S GOT A WHOLE ROW OF BOOKSHELVES ON ONE SIDE
1841.IT'S HARD TO BLAME HIM BECAUSE HE GREW UP IN A HOUSEHOLD WITHOUT LOVE
1842.IT'S HARD TO NOT FEEL SHAME BECAUSE I WONDER HOW MANY WERE AFRAID
1843.IT'S JUST THE JOB BUT YOU KNOW WHAT AT THE END OF THE DAY NO MATTER WHAT JOB YOU'RE DOING
1844.IT'S JUST THE WAY SOME PEOPLE COMMUNICATE AND IT DOESN'T STAND OUT FOR ME ANYMORE
1845.IT'S JUST YOU AND ME YEP
1846.IT'S JUST YOU NEED A DIFFERENT TOOL TO EXPRESS YOUR LOVE AND SUPPORT OF HER
1847.IT'S LIKE MAN NOW YOU NEED SOME INGENUITY
1848.IT'S MASSIVE IT'S GOT A GIANT CASTLE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT RIGHT SITTIN' ON TOP OF A PYRAMID
1849.IT'S MORE LIKE A WAITING ROOM THAT DOESN'T SUCK
1850.IT'S NICE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE AT THE PHARMACY
1851.IT'S NO TELLING HOW MUCH MONEY HE MADE IN THE CLOCK TRADE
1852.IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE AND IT'S NOT GOING TO STOP BECAUSE ALL WE'RE DOING IS HIDING IT
1853.IT'S NOT THE MOST NORMAL SEQUENCE OF EVENTS
1854.IT'S NOT WHAT I WANT TO BE
1855.IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT FOR PUTTING YOURSELF IN A SITUATION NOBODY
1856.IT'S ONLY EIGHT BUCKS A MONTH AND YOU GET A FREE DOMAIN IF YOU BUY SQUARE SPACE FOR THE YEAR
1857.IT SOUNDS LIKE OUR PATHS ARE GOING TO CROSS TRUDY AND THAT WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE BUT
1858.IT'S PRODUCED BY A GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH TIES TO THE PRISON INCLUDING OUR RECENTLY RELEASED FRIEND JONATHAN CHIU
1859.IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO LET MYSELF BE ANGRY HURT STRESSED SCARED WHEN THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT COMES UP
1860.IT'S RETA AND TWO OTHER WOMEN WHO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES AS COUSINS OF JOHN'S AS WELL AS RETA'S HUSBAND CHARLIE
1861.IT'S SO COMPELLING BECAUSE YOU JUST THINK HOW THE FUCK ARE THEY DOING THAT
1862.IT'S SO HARD TO JUST SIT WITH THEM IN THEIR PAIN AND NOT TRY TO
1863.IT'S SO MUCH EASIER FOR ME TO BE COMPASSIONATE BUT I AM YOU KNOW I'M HUMAN
1864.IT'S STILL NOT YOUR FUCKING FAULT
1865.IT STARTS IN MY THROAT AND MOVES DOWNWARD THROUGH MY CHEST EXPANDING AS IT SPREADS OUTWARD IN A SENSATION SIMILAR TO THAT OF DRINKING ICE COLD WATER FIRST THING IN THE MORNING
1866.IT'S THE FEELINGS UNDERNEATH IT THAT MAKE US WANT TO DRINK OR GET HIGH OR SHOPLIFT OR WHATEVER
1867.IT'S THEN OUR RESPONSIBILITY WHICH SEEMS LIKE IT SUCKS BUT IT'S THE
1868.IT'S THE THING THAT STANDS BETWEEN YOU AND HAVING MEANING AND PURPOSE
1869.IT'S TOMMY SHAKUR ROSS WHO'S CURRENTLY INCARCERATED AT SAN QUENTIN PRISON AND HAS BEEN ON OUR SHOW A FEW TIMES I'MMA BRING IT TO LIKE RELATIVELY RECENT
1870.IT'S UP TO EACH PRISONER TO FIND THEIR OWN REASONS TO KEEP GOING
1871.IT'S USUALLY WHEN I'M JUST OUT OF ENERGY AND SELF-CONTROL WHEN HE'S BEING ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT AND I FEEL ANXIETY ABOUT OUR FUTURE
1872.IT TOLD ME THAT MY FATHER WAS
1873.IT TOOK ME YEARS OF BEING SCARED TO LET GO OF OF TRUE
1874.IT TURNED OUT TO BE TWO PEN PALS
1875.I TURNED AND ASKED IF HE THOUGHT HIS HUSBAND WOULD MIND MY USING HIM AS AN ARMREST
1876.IT WAS A BIG DEAL FOR CURTIS
1877.IT WAS A FLEDGLING TUFTED TITMOUSE
1878.IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A SWITCH WENT OFF
1879.IT WAS ALMOST LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER CALLING YOU KNOW IT WAS THE NEXT BEST THING
1880.IT WAS ALMOST THERE IT WAS RIGHT ON THE CUSP OF IT YOU KNOW I GET A LOT OF
1881.IT WAS ALWAYS ANNOYING AND WOULD MAKE ME ROLL MY EYES AND SCOFF LIKE
1882.IT WAS ALWAYS COMPLETELY SOMEBODY ELSE'S FAULT
1883.IT WAS AN ISSUE WITH A PIECE CALLED THE GATHERING PALLET
1884.IT WAS AS IF I GOT EVIDENCE AT THAT MOMENT THAT YES
1885.IT WAS BENEFICIAL IN SO FAR AS IMPROVING OUR CO-HABITING
1886.IT WAS JUST ALSO A UM
1887.IT WAS JUST A NORMAL DAY THE SAME THING THAT WE ALWAYS DO YOU KNOW WE GO IN
1888.IT WAS JUST A SAD BUT SWEET MEMORY
1889.IT WAS LIKE A COMA IT
1890.IT WAS NEARLY THE SAME COLOR AS THE BLUE GREY ASPHALT BUT NOT THE RIGHT SHAPE I WALKED OVER AND THERE SITTING QUITE STILL WAS A LITTLE GREY BIRD
1891.IT WAS NOT QUITE A BABY SQUIRREL AND NOT QUITE FULL GROWN MY MOTHER RESCUED IT WHEN THE CAT DROPPED IT FROM HIS MOUTH
1892.IT WASN'T AN INCREDIBLE OR MIND-BLOWING MOMENT IT WAS JUST A NORMAL HUMAN CONNECTION
1893.IT WASN'T THAT YOU WERE TRAPPED IT'S LIKE YOU WERE TRAPPED
1894.IT WAS ONE OF OUR MOST INTIMATE AND LOVING MOMENTS WE EVER HAD
1895.IT WAS PROFOUND AND TOTALLY FUCKING AWFULSOME
1896.IT WAS REALLY HARD TO PROCESS EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON BECAUSE I WAS HAVING A REALLY BAD TRIP
1897.IT WAS SOME BROTHERS CAME DOWN FROM SOLITARY RIGHT
1898.IT WAS THE LAST DAY OF FEBRUARY THAT I SAW HIM

CASES ARE INCREASINGLY EXPONENTIAL
IT COULD BE LEVEL TWO WHERE IT'S A COMBINATION OF IN PERSON AND OR IN REALLY A GOOD SITUATION IT COULD BE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT IN PERSON

UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON SCIENTISTS HAVE SUCCEEDED IN REMOVING THE EXTRA COPY OF CHROMOSOME TWENTY ONE IN CELL CULTURES DERIVED FROM A PERSON WITH DOWN SYNDROME A CONDITION IN WHICH THE BODY'S CELLS CONTAIN THREE COPIES OF CHROMOSOME TWENTY ONE RATHER THAN THE USUAL PAIR
AND HOW TO DEAL WITH IF WE DO HAVE A STUDENT OR AN EMPLOYEE WHO DEMONSTRATES THAT THEY HAVE SYMPTOMS OF COVID NINETEEN
NOT SHOWING UP AND BEING VERY LATE FOR SCHOOL AND SO KIDS WERE BEING
COULD WE ESCAPE OUT OF THE SEGMENT SELECTOR
ARE YOU MEANING WHEN IT SAYS SO PART OF MY QUESTION WAS BECAUSE THIS SAYS ALL STUDENTS
SCIENTISTS IDENTIFY FIVE GENES THAT DETERMINE THE FORM OF THE HUMAN FACE IN A FIND THAT COULD LEAD TO POLICE IDENTIFICATION SKETCHES BASED SOLELY ON DNA FINDINGS
SO YOU CAN THEN JUST EXTRACT ALL THE DNA FROM SUCH A FOSSIL SEQUENCE RANDOMLY ALL THE DNA MOLECULES IN IT
CHILDREN CAN AND HAVE HAD RESPIRATORY AND HOSPITALIZATIONS DUE TO COVID
ALSO IN DECEMBER
CONSENT CALENDAR ITEM FOURTEEN A FIVE
WITH THAT IN MIND IT IS OUR STRONG BELIEF THAT THE BEST THING FOR OUR CHILDREN WOULD BE TO RETURN TO SCHOOL TO ITS PAST NORMALCY
SO IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT I WANT TO CODE
THERE'S A BOARD ITEM TONIGHT WHERE YOU APPROVED PURCHASE OF ILLUSTRATIVE MATH MATERIALS
THAT WAY THE TEACHERS COULD STILL HAVE ONE A M OR P M SECTION A WEEK FOR DEVELOPMENT OR STUDENT ENRICHMENT
HOW MANY RESPONSES ARE YOU GOING TO NEED TO GET A CLEAR ANSWER

SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMINO ACID CHANGES THERE ONLY NINETY SIX AMINO ACID CHANGES IN THIS CATEGORY THAT AFFECT EIGHTY SEVEN PROTEINS AND THIS IS A LIST OF THESE PROTEINS HERE
CAN TAKE THE PLACE OF A TEACHER AND LIVE INSTRUCTION
THE SAME SYSTEM COULD THEN BE USED TO DELIVER PRECISION RADIOTHERAPY TREATMENTS

COMMENT FROM KATE CERNOK
I GUESS ANOTHER YEAH

LOOKING TO THE MOST STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS FROM THE STATE FROM THE ORANGE COUNTY
IT IS A CONTRACT FOR RODRIGUEZ ENGINEERING FOR STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING WORK
I HAVE BRITTANY NEVINS
WE APPRECIATE THE CONSTRAINTS PLACED ON THE DISTRICT AND TEACHERS AND THE COMMITMENT OF THE LEVEL TWO PLAN BUT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE PREPARED FOR THE NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE ACADEMIC ADVANCEMENT
THIS CANNOT CONTINUE FOR THEIR MENTAL STATE'S SAKE
THE OTHER COMMENTS
LET'S SEE
SCIENCE SHOWS OUR STUDENTS ARE AT LOW RISK FOR CONTRACTING COVID NINETEEN AND FOR PASSING IT ON
CHANGE
AND IN MANY TIMES THAT'S THAT'S GOOD THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE
MAKE NO MISTAKE THAT THIS IS NOT A PLAN FOR INSTRUCTION
THIS IS PLAYING WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES

GUSTY WINDS LEFT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND WITHOUT POWER DURING THE STORM'S PASSAGE
BOTH IN SCHOOL AND AT HOME

IT WOULD BE CONDENSED
KIDS LEARN AT DIFFERENT RATES WITH DIFFERENT METHODS TEACHERS CAN TELL THAT IN PERSON AND NOT VIA SCREEN
SVANTE PAABO WILL JOIN THAT LIST WITH A LECTURE THAT IS CERTAINLY A KINDRED SUBJECT TO THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL IN THAT IT MIGHT BE SAID TO BE ON THE IMMORTALITY OF NEANDERTHAL DNA
SARA DID YOU READ JULIA EDWARDS I BELIEVE THAT'S
IN OTHER WORDS THE STRUCTURE HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED
DISTANCE LEARNING
AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO PAUSE THE VIDEO AND TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT ON YOUR OWN
YOU KNOW TREMENDOUS SUPPORT
SWITCHING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN IN PERSON AND ONLINE SEEMS FAR MORE DISRUPTIVE TO STUDENT LEARNING THAN ALL ONLINE

COMMENT FROM VICKIE GUTIERREZ
WE'RE TAKING THE FIRST TEN COMMENTS
WHAT WAS WERE THE CONTAMINANTS HOW FAR DID YOU HAVE TO DIG TO REMOVE THE DIRTY SOIL
I HAVE TO SAY OUT OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW THAT I'VE MET WITH OVER THE LAST YEAR
AND SS
ALL RIGHT SO THE THIRD REQUIREMENT IS THAT I GUESS THE INDIRECT JUMPS
EXERCISE IS IMPORTANT
TRANSPARENCY RESPECT ENGAGEMENT ENVIRONMENT STAKEHOLDERS
THE FLOODING DESTROYED SIX THOUSAND HOUSES AND DAMAGED TWENTY THOUSAND OTHERS

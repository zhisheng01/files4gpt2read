THIS PROCESS IS DESCRIBED AS A STEP ALONG THE PATH TOWARD AMINO ACIDS AND NUCLEOTIDES THE RAW MATERIALS OF PROTEINS AND DNA RESPECTIVELY
AT WHICH TIME SHE HAD A LEFT MASTECTOMY PERFORMED WITH CHEMOTHERAPY ADMINISTRATION
YOU CAN COME BACK
MEETING NEW FRIENDS AND CREATING POSITIVE OUTLOOK ON LIFE
IN ADDITION MITCH CAUSED MODERATE RAINFALL PEAKING AT SEVEN INCHES IN JUPITER THOUGH SOME ESTIMATES INDICATE LOCALIZED TOTALS OF UP TO TEN INCHES
ONE HUNDRED PERCENT DISTANCE LEARNING FROM THE START OF THE SCHOOL YEAR IS PREFERRED BASED ON THE RISING COVID NINETEEN NUMBERS IN OUR STATE AND THE RISK OF CONTRACTION FOR OUR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS
WHAT LEVEL WE'RE GOING TO BE IN FOR THE START OF THE SCHOOL YEAR
ABOUT ANY OF THAT OR HAVE ANY THOUGHTS
BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS WE DON'T WANT THIS TO OCCUR ON WEDNESDAY BECAUSE ON WEDNESDAY
WE CAN COMMIT TO EVERYONE STAFF
ALL RIGHT I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE SLIDE HERE THAT ACTUALLY SHOWS THE STRUCTURE
THE AMBER FOSSIL DATES BACK BETWEEN NINETY SEVEN MILLION AND ONE HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION YEARS
OVERALL THE UNITED STATES HAS THE MOST SUPERCOMPUTERS LISTED IN THE GLOBAL TOP FIVE HUNDRED WITH TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE CHINA IS IN SECOND PLACE WITH SEVENTY TWO
THERE'S AN OPTION THERE

PARTICULARLY WITH A VIEW TO THEN SEEING WHAT IS UNIQUE TO FULLY MODERN HUMANS COMPARED TO OUR CLOSEST RELATIVES
AND COURSERA OWNS A PIECE
LINDA BECKHAM I'M A BUDGET DIRECTOR FOR ENROLLMENT STUDENT SERVICES

OKAY
THANK YOU TIM ANYBODY ELSE
WHAT WILL THE IDEAL SUPPORT FOR THIS LOOK LIKE UNDER HALF DAY LEARNING
MAKE SENSE
PLEASE DO NOT IGNORE THE ARTS
COMMENT BY KIMBERLY
OKAY HI
BRING
SOUTH KOREAN SCIENTISTS DEVELOP TOUCHSCREENS THAT CAN RECOGNISE THE EXISTENCE AND CONCENTRATION OF DNA MOLECULES PLACED ON THEM
AND THEY'RE HAVING TO MAKE SOME DIFFICULT DECISIONS RIGHT NOW
WE WOULD TAKE THE TOTAL OF AGES
WHAT ABOUT SO THIS IS FOR JUMPS
AND MAYBE THIS PERSON
THANK YOU
WHICH I SHOULD TELL YOU ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT IS DEDICATED TO AN EXPLORATION OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL OR OTHER KINDRED SUBJECTS

THE PEOPLE IN CHINA FOR EXAMPLE ALSO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF DENISOVAN DNA
THE NEW JOURNAL TITLED ELIFE IS PART OF A WIDESPREAD PUSH FOR OPEN ACCESS TO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND WILL COMPEL RESEARCHERS TO MAKE THEIR WORK FREELY AVAILABLE ONLINE
THEY COME OUT OF AFRICA AND IN WESTERN EURASIA EVOLVED INTO WHAT WE CALLED NEANDERTHALS
AND LO AND BEHOLD IT'S THE SAME CHALLENGES WE'RE FACING
THEN THEY'RE IN THE THREE LEVEL ADAPTABLE PLAN
I UNDERSTAND THAT RECENTLY SOME
IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT A TWO WEEK IN PERSON SUBSTITUTE TEACHER IS FAR LESS DESIRABLE FROM A LEARNING STANDPOINT THAN THE PRIMARY TEACHER RUNNING DISTANCE LEARNING DURING THAT PERIOD
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TUITION
WHAT ARE THEY WORRIED ABOUT
SO WE WILL LOOK AT THAT AND WE LOOK AT ALL THE ORDERS THAT ARE IN PLACE FROM THE NATIONAL STATE COUNTY LEVEL

AND I JUST WISH YOU THE BEST IN EVERYTHING YOU DO BECAUSE YOU DESERVE IT
WHERE ARE THE STAKEHOLDERS
IBM RESEARCHERS HAVE SIMULATED FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION NEURONS AND ONE HUNDRED TRILLION SYNAPSES ON A SUPERCOMPUTER
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE AIMING FOR
THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT THE ACIDITY OF THE VACUOLE IS CRITICAL TO AGING AND THE STABLE FUNCTIONING OF MITOCHONDRIA
YOU DEMONSTRATED YOUR INTENT BY NOT GERRYMANDERING YOUR AREAS TWO YEARS AGO CONTINUE YOUR PROCESS
I FOUND IT RIGHT HERE AND I GO DOWN AND I FIND BREAST
AN INTERNATIONAL TEAM OF RESEARCHERS DISCOVERS A GENE THAT HELPS EXPLAIN HOW HUMANS EVOLVED FROM CHIMPANZEES

WE ARE WONDERING ABOUT THE LOGISTICS OF A POSITIVE TEST IN A SCHOOL OR CLASSROOM
JUST FOR EVERYBODY WHO'S THERE
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SAY THAT SENTENCE AS ETHAN WAS A FORMER STUDENT OF MINE WHEN HE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY FROM ST LUCIA TO LIVE WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER ROFINA HE WAS SHY BUT HOPEFUL HESITANT
THERE WASN'T ALREADY A DESIGN TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THIS MIRROR OF THE MEMORIAL

COMMENT FROM KIMBERLY CLAYTOR
I THINK THAT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE DOING THAT

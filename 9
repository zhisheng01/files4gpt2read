PLEASE LET THEM
AND WHAT YOU SEE HERE IN THIS WEB PAGE IS THE LITTLE BIT OF JAVASCRIPT CODE THAT'S NECESSARY IN NATIVE CLIENT TO INTERRACT WITH THE PARTICULAR NACL MODULE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE RUNNING
AND WHAT WE ARE SEEKING TONIGHT IS A VERY IMPORTANT DECISION AND DIRECTION RELATED TO ONE OF THE CONTINGENCY MODELS THAT WE NEED TO PREPARE FOR AND HAVE IN PLACE
HOW MUCH OF THE NEANDERTHAL GENOME REMAINS TODAY
THE INVENTION COULD SAVE LIVES BY GIVING PEOPLE MORE TIME TO FLEE FROM COLLAPSING BUILDINGS
IT IS NOT FAIR TO THE CHILDREN OR PARENTS TO NOT HAVE THEM ON CAMPUS
ALSO FINDING CHILDCARE
AS A RESULT OF THE ORANGE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF ED MEETING LAST NIGHT
HE LOVED JESUS
THE CONCEPT IS THAT STUDENTS FIRST OF ALL ARE IN CLASSROOM A HALF DAY WITH THEIR TEACHER
BUT I WISH YOU GREAT HAPPINESS AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A GREAT TIME WITH LAUREN AND YOUR BOYS AND THE FLY FISHING
WILL EVERYONE ENTERING CAMPUS BE REQUIRED TO WEAR MASKS
THE FIRST PLACE WHERE THIS WORKED WAS IN SOUTHERN EUROPE IN CROATIA
I HAVE A PIECE OF ADVICE FRED
REST OF CENTRAL AMERICA DUE TO MITCH'S LARGE CIRCULATION IT DROPPED HEAVY PRECIPITATION AS FAR SOUTH AS PANAMA
CAUSE IT IS A VERY REWARDING JOB AND I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD OF OUR DISTRICT AND IT IS GOING TO BE HARD
AND TWENTY PEOPLE WERE INJURED
PEOPLES' LIVES ARE AT STAKE
AND SO WITH THAT CONSIDERATION
WHAT TYPES OF CLEANING MATERIALS WILL BE USED AND WILL MORE JANITORS BE HIRED
IT IS THE FIRST SUCH DISCOVERY IN NORTH AMERICA FOR MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS
RECOMMENDED MOTION HERE
HUMAN DISEASES COULD SOON BE MODELED IN AN ELECTRONIC ORGAN-ON-A-CHIP
SHE TOLD ME SHE JUST WANTS TO BE IN SCHOOL IN PERSON WITH TEACHERS AND FRIENDS AND WANTS TO LEARN IN THAT ENVIRONMENT
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE BORDERS BETWEEN THESE HAVE BEEN BUT WE DO KNOW THAT IN THIS PART IN SIBERIA THERE HAD BEEN NEANDERTHALS AS WELL AS DENISOVANS AT SOME TIME IN HISTORY
THE REOPENING HAVE BEEN READ INTO THE RECORD AND THEY ARE AT THE BEGINNING OF
ANOTHER THING THAT KIND OF CAME OUT OF THIS DISCUSSION WAS THAT
SO HAVING RESOURCES LIKE THAT WAS NICE BUT AS FAR AS THE
WE LOOKED THROUGH MANY ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES AND MANY BONES AND FOCUSED ON THREE BONES FROM THAT CAVE IN CROATIA FROM THREE DIFFERENT NEANDERTHAL INDIVIDUALS
INDICATES THAT THE PARENTS OF THIS INDIVIDUAL WERE CLOSELY RELATED
THAT'S REALLY ALL WE CAN SAY FROM THE GENETIC DATA
I WON'T BE MISSED
WHAT IF YOUR KID TESTED POSITIVE
THE LACK OF LEARNING AND SOCIALIZATION IS SPIRALING HER DOWNWARD MENTALLY PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY
BUT WE ARE TAKING MAKING ADJUSTMENTS
EITHER AS AN ATTACHMENT IF SPACE IS A CONSIDERATION BUT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO KNOW AND LIKE FOR THE COMMUNITY TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION WHEN WE'RE MAKING A RESOLUTION ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS
IT'S NOT FOR THE ENSIGN PROJECT
AND CONSISTENT WITH A NULL RESULT
THE ENTIRE GENOME OF AN EXTINCT SPECIES OF HUMAN THE FORTY THOUSAND YEAR OLD DENISOVA HOMININ HAS BEEN DECODED FROM A FOSSIL
SO THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT THE RESEARCH AND EVEN TRUE DISTANCE LEARNING ISN'T THAT MUCH SCREEN TIME
THEY NEED SOCIAL INTERACTION AND HANDS ON TEACHING
BUT THERE IS IF YOU LIKE THEN A PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL AND THAT IS THAT WHEN MODERN HUMANS THEN COME OUT OF AFRICA
MODULE OR WHATEVER IT IS WE'LL DO FOR THE IN BOUNDS CHECKS
BUT ALWAYS SOUGHT TO BE CLOSE BY OTHERS AND INCLUDED
THE PRINTABLE INVENTION COULD POTENTIALLY REVOLUTIONISE THE FIELD OF AUGMENTED REALITY
STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE FACE TO FACE INSTRUCTION
AND YOU TRUST IN US
THEY SHOW UP TO LEARN THEY DO NOT CAUSE TROUBLE THEY GET GOOD GRADES VOLUNTEER START CLUBS
AND INDEED STATISTICALLY SPEAKING THAT'S FIFTY FIFTY IT'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO
I AGREE THAT DISTANCE EDUCATION IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO IN PERSON EDUCATION AND THAT IT POSES A REAL CHALLENGE TO ALL INVOLVED
IT IS LIKELY THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO SPREAD
BUT ONE OF THOSE BASEBALL PLAYERS WAS PICKED UP TO BE A PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL PLAYER
AND WHAT WILL THAT MODEL BE FOR A SECONDARY
YES
STUDENTS FROM OTHER DISTRICTS APPARENTLY WILL NOT BE BRINGING THEIR FUNDING WITH THEM AND OUR FUNDING WILL REMAIN STATIC DESPITE THESE TRANSFERS
I LEARNED A LOT AND BUT I
WITH THAT
THE INTERESTING PART IS ROUGHLY THIS HANDLE MESSAGE FUNCTION
WE ARE PLEASED
THE END OF THE LAST SCHOOL YEAR WAS VERY CHALLENGING AND WE FEEL WE HAD SOME OF THE BEST TEACHERS IN THE DISTRICT
AT LEAST THERE WOULD BE AN OPTION TO PREVENT THESE STUDENTS BEING AT LOOSE ENDS AND WITHOUT ADULT SUPERVISION FOR SO MANY HOURS
YOU SHOULD ASSUME THAT EVEN IF MASKS ARE REQUIRED MISTAKES WILL OCCUR AND STUDENTS WILL NOT BE HARSHLY DISCIPLINED
IN THE UNTRUSTED MODULE
MARTHA
SO MERRY GRASSKA WHO'S BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH KRISTEN CLARK
AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO BE ONE WEEK LONG A VERY INTENSIVE STUDY
FROM ERIC MAZUR I LEARNED ABOUT PEER INSTRUCTION
IF WE CAN'T RELY ON MANDATORY MASK USE FOR STUDENT AND TEACHERS
IF A TEACHER TESTS POSITIVE OF COVID NINETEEN
SO ON JUNE TWENTY THIRD THIS WAS A SLIDE THAT WAS SHARED WITH THE BOARD
AND THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE'RE AT UNLESS THINGS GET WORSE AND THERE ARE SOME ORDERS
ENJOY THE FLY ROD
SO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE BEING ASKED THIS EVENING
ALL THE REST OF THE COMMENTS SUBMITTED ON THIRTEEN A
CREATING AN ENTIRELY SEPARATE VIRTUAL SCHOOL AND HAVING TO HIRE A WHOLE NEW SLATE OF TEACHERS JUST SEEMS MUCH MORE COSTLY AND UNNECESSARY
WE ANNOUNCED THE CLASS ON JULY TWENTY NINE
WOULD THEY BE SURROUNDED BY THEIR NORMAL CLASS PEERS AND TEACHERS WHAT ABOUT THE LEVEL TWO OPTION OF HALF DAYS INSIDE THE CLASSROOM
DISTRIB
THE AMAZING EDUCATORS OF THE NEWPORT MESA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HAVE SPECIAL EXPERTISE
PLEASE GET THESE KIDS BACK IN SCHOOL NOW
THEN THE TRUSTED SERVICE RUNTIME MIGHT BE TRICKED INTO DOING SOMETHING
IN THE FLORIDA KEYS MULTIPLE BUILDINGS THAT HAD BEEN DAMAGED BY HURRICANE GEORGES WERE LEVELED BY MITCH
COMMENT FROM ERICA
SO WHY NOT
COMMENT FROM GRACE COFFMAN
AS A SPECIALIST IN THE DISTRICT I TRAVEL AND SHARE WORKSPACES BEFORE COVID SOME FACILITIES AT SITES DID NOT PROVIDE SPACE TO MEET THE NEEDS TO WORK PRIVATELY AND CONFIDENTIALLY
SO AS WAS SAID IN THE INTRODUCTION I WILL THEN PERHAPS IF YOU LIKE NOT TALK ABOUT THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL BUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE IMMORTALITY OF NEANDERTHALS IF YOU LIKE
PLEASE LET OUR CHILDREN REENTER SCHOOL IN SEPTEMBER
JUST AS NEANDERTHALS ARE CALLED NEANDERTHALS AFTER NEANDERTHAL WHERE THEY WERE FOUND
SADLY THE NEWPORT MESA SCHOOL BOARD HAS A LOUSY HISTORY OF HIRING SUPERINTENDENTS GOING BACK TWENTY FIVE YEARS
WE WILL HAVE MORE AND MORE COMMENTS
THAT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT
WHEN YOU GO TO THE VIRTUAL ACADEMY AND YOU HAVE A TEACHER MAY NOT BE A TEACHER AT EAST BLUFF OR MAY NOT BE A TEACHER
THANK YOU SO MUCH ASHLEY SO SHE'S MOVED IT MAY I HAVE A SECOND PLEASE
IT IS INCREDIBLY HARD TO WORK WITH OUR CHILD WHILE BOTH OF US CONTINUE TO WORK FULL TIME
NEAR AND UNDER THE MATURE DECIDUOUS SYCAMORES
END QUOTE
FOR PARENTS THE PROSPECT OF BEING REQUIRED TO WORK WHILE THE SCHOOLS REMAIN SHUT DOWN IS AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE SCENARIO
AND THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR GENES INVOLVED IN THAT IS THIS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR E P A S ONE
I THINK THAT WOULD BE MY PREFERENCE FOR THAT WEDNESDAY TIME

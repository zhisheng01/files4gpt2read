PROCEED ANYWAY
AND I THINK AT THAT MOMENT I THOUGHT
THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF
IT'S SO PROFOUND IN ITS AUGMENTATION
THANK YOU TO TRIPLEBYTE
THIS WAS AMAZING
THUMBTACK IS NOW ABLE TO AVOID THE ASYNCHRONOUS BIDDING PROCESS THAT COST PEOPLE A LOT OF TIME
CONTRACT-TO-HIRE LETS YOU ACTUALLY WORK WITH THE ENGINEER ON A REAL PROJECT AND IT COMPENSATES THAT ENGINEER FOR THEIR TIME IT'S ALWAYS SURPRISED ME THAT CONTRACT-TO-HIRE IS NOT MORE WIDELY USED
AND I HAD USED CAMERA TRAPS TO ALSO SPY ON PORCUPINES TWO YEARS EARLIER
SLOW KITTENS
OF COMPUTER SCIENCE FUNDAMENTALS SOFTWARE ENGINEERING BEST PRACTICES
SO WE'RE ALMOST IT'S A CONCESSION TO HOW PEOPLE ARE OR MEETING PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE
PUT THEM IN A COUPLE OF CELLS HIGHLIGHTED IT AND THEN MADE A CHART OUT OF IT
ALL RIGHT
IT'S NOT TOO BAD BUT IT'S NOT GREAT
THE INTERNAL DATA PLATFORM IS INCREDIBLY FRACTURED
THAT'S WHY THAT ICON DISAPPEARED
AS YOU CAN SEE I HAVE TWO MICROSERVICES MY FRONT END WHICH IS TALKING TO CLOUD MEMORYSTORE FOR SESSION CACHING
WITH NOW
IT IS GOING TO TAKE GR IT
AND THERE'S KIND OF AN ADDITIONAL LET'S SEE HOW MANY TIMES IT TAKES BEFORE THIS TRIGGERS
LISTENERS OF THIS PODCAST WILL ALSO GET A FREE T-SHIRT FOR TRYING DATADOG GO TO SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM SLASH DATADOG TO GET THAT FREE T-SHIRT AND THAT FOURTEEN DAY FREE TRIAL
THERE'S VERY LITTLE RISK AND YOU MIGHT FIND YOURSELF IN A GREAT POSITION GETTING MULTIPLE ONSITE INTERVIEWS FROM JUST ONE QUIZ AND A TRIPLEBYTE INTERVIEW
YOU CAN CHECK OUT OPENSHIFT FROM RED HAT BY GOING TO SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM SLASH REDHAT
I THINK THEY'RE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
AND SO THIS IS WHEN YOU GET INTO MORE OF A COMPILER LEVEL UNDERSTANDING OF THE CODE
YOU'RE WAITING A FEW MIL LISECONDS BECAUSE THIS ENTIRE PLATFORM RUNS RIGHT IN YOUR BROWSER
FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS AND NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED EPISODES
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR BUILDING A FOLLOWING OR IS WORD OF MOUTH WORKING JUST FINE FOR YOU FUNNY ENOUGH
ONE IS GOING TO WELL
WE'LL JUST MAKE THEM DO JAVA INSTEAD BECAUSE THAT WAS HOW THEY WRITTEN THEIR TRADING PLATFORM
AND IT'S ALSO A LITTLE BIT HIGHER LATENCY
ROLL THEIR OWN INFRASTRUCTURE
THROUGH TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION
A LITTLE BECAUSE MANY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN A SIMILAR EFFECT IN ADULTS
AND WE ALSO HAVE A PLACEHOLDER DIV HERE FOR OUR CHART
HOW COOL IS THAT
ALL WHILE INCREASING THE SECURITY RELIABILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF CRITICAL BUSINESS WORKLOADS WITH AZURE
AND THESE ARE SOME VERY BASIC ONES NONE OF THESE REALLY TELL THE RIGHT STORY
NOW
HE SAID
AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN
BUT WITHOUT HAVING TO MODIFY THE CODE
SO THOSE ARE THINGS WHERE WE'VE ALMOST HAD TO TAILOR THE INSTRUCTION TO THE MEDIUM AND THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE MEDIUM
SO THIS DIFFERENT WAY OF NOT PUTTING ALL YOUR EGGS IN THAT ONE SERVER BASKET SORT OF SOLVES A LOT OF PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IN THE DEPLOYMENT SPACE
AT THE SAME TIME
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE KIND OF ALSO FACED AT DIGITALOCEAN
IN THIS CASE WE'RE JUST DOING A VERY SIMPLE DATA TABLE WHERE WE'RE SAYING THE TOPPING AND THE NUMBER OF SLICES
AND IT IS STILL BOTH INFORMATIVE
WHICH IS CRAZY
WELL I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BAMBOOZLEMENT THEORY IS TRUE OF SOME WRITERS SOME OF THE TIME BUT AS A GENERAL EXPLANATION IT DOESN'T RING TRUE
THEY'RE HORRIFYING THEY'RE SO MUCH MORE SCARY THAN PUMPKINS
IT'S A SURVEY SO WE CAN MAKE EVEN BETTER SHOWS
BECAUSE WE USED TO WRITE SOFTWARE THIS WAY AND WE LEARN ABOUT ALL ITS PITFALLS
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO TAKE MUCH MORE THAN THAT
G TWO I IS THE COMPANY THAT I CALL ON TO HELP ME FIND A DEVELOPER WHO CAN BUILD THE FIRST VERSION OF MY PRODUCT
AND HE WAS SO GOOD AND SO GENEROUS WITH HIS EXPLANATIONS OF VARIOUS DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS CONCEPTS
SO YOU HAVE THE SAME IDEA
SINGULAR THEY BEING AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE
SO A COUPLE MORE EXAMPLES AND THESE ARE OLDER
LOOK AT THIS
CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
AND THEY COME TOGETHER IN EPISODES
AND SO ON
WHY IS THIS SO PROBLEMATIC WHY IS THE LAUNDRY PROBLEM SO PROBLEMATIC WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD THIS INSTANT MATCHING MARKETPLACE
IT MINIMIZES THE CODE REQUIRED TO BUILD DATA-RICH WEB APPLICATIONS AND MAXIMIZES YOUR TIME SPENT ON YOUR EXPERTISE
TO ADD THE ACTION
ON THIS AXIS YOU CAN SEE HOW THE FLUID DISTURBANCES GET MORE PRONOUNCED AS A RESPONSE TO A STRONGER MAGNETIC FIELD
NODE JS IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE THESE ARE OPEN-SOURCE PROJECTS THAT HAVE MASSIVE TRACTION
BUT IT'S ALSO SO YOU WANNA REDUCE THE NUMBER OF DOM NODES AND WE'RE ONLY DOING ONE DOM NODE PER MARKER HERE
A POPULAR PODCAST
G TWO I IS A HIRING PLATFORM RUN BY ENGINEERS THAT MATCHES YOU WITH REACT REACT NATIVE GRAPHQL AND MOBILE ENGINEERS WHO YOU CAN TRUST
SO THERE'S CLUSTERING AND CLUSTERING IS WHAT YOU USE WHEN YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE USER CAN EVENTUALLY ACTUALLY CLICK ON THE MARKER BECAUSE WITH CLUSTERING YOU CAN ALWAYS ZOOM IN FAR ENOUGH AND ACTUALLY HAVE CLICKABLE MARKERS
ROAD PIZZA
HOW ARE BLOBS OF DATA AND BLOCK STORAGE FOR DATABASES HOW ARE THOSE DIFFERENT TYPES OF STORAGE MANAGED ACROSS CLOUD FOUNDRY
SO THE STORY I'M GONNA TELL YOU IS ABOUT ME
GET EVERYTHING THAT FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE ALREADY LOVE ABOUT STACK OVERFLOW IN A PRIVATE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT WITH STACK OVERFLOW FOR TEAMS
IT'S REALLY ENTIRELY UP TO YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO IMPLEMENT THERE
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT COST TRADEOFFS FOR STORAGE
YEAH THIS LOCKED UP THE SOFTWARE
THAT MEANS YOU CAN SHOOT LONGER WITH MORE INEXPENSIVE MEDIA
BUT THE MORE I FIRE MY MUSCLES THE MORE TORQUE I GET AND I CAN EVEN RUN
THAT BECOMES EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN FACT TABLE STAKES
YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE THIS STUFF AWAY TO PEOPLE
THEY LAST A REALLY LONG TIME
AS FAR AS GOOGLE MAPS IS CONCERNED SUPERMARKER IS JUST ONE MARKER
IT TAKES ABOUT TEN MINUTES AND YOU MIGHT WIN A SWEET T-SHIRT
I CAN TELL YOU IF I WENT TO A WEBSITE THAT TOOK FIFTEEN PLUS SECONDS TO RENDER A WEB PAGE EVERY TIME I CLICKED A LINK
I DON'T NEED TO RUN MY INSTANCE TO THERE FOR INSTANCE
SO IT'S THREE CHARACTERS OR THREE WORDS
IS ONE OF THE MANY THINGS IT DOES
I ALSO HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE VISITING FROM WITHIN THE UNITED STATES
WHAT WERE YOU ABLE TO STRIP AWAY OR WHAT KIND OF PERFORMANCE AREAS WERE YOU ABLE TO IMPROVE
SOME TIME AGO DID A STUDY AND THEY CALLED IT NEAT
THAT'S ONE ONE OPTION
YOU'RE NOT MOZI LLA
THAT HAS LED SOME SCIENTISTS TO TRY AND PROVOKE A RESPONSE LIKE JAMES OUR MASTER OF MICROSCOPES USING A PIECE OF HAIR TO POKE THESE STENTORS
SO HERE WE SEE OH
THEY CAN SHARE ASSETS BETWEEN THEM THAT ARE SHARED AT COMPILE TIME
BASICALLY TAKING ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND KIND OF BREAKING IT TO FUNCTION NOT REALLY BUT BASICALLY YOU CAN CALL IT THAT WAY

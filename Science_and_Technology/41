I GUESS DIFFERENT NETWORKING PRIMITIVES THAT I WANTED TO KNOW HOW THEY WORKED AND I FI GURED THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE BY BUILDING ONE SO I THINK LOAD BALANCER WAS ONE OF THEM
MORE GENERALLY ENGLISH SYNTAX PROVIDES WRITERS WITH CONSTRUCTIONS THAT VARY THE ORDER IN THE STRING WHILE PRESERVING THE MEANING
MEANING IT SELF-DESCRIBES
WHO WROTE THIS CRAP
VERY SPECIAL EPISODE OF OLOGIES COMES OUT ON HALLOWEEN
PHONES OR MEETS OR TEXTS ANOTHER AS LONG AS THEY DO GET IN TOUCH WITH THEM BY ONE MEANS OR ANOTHER
BUT NOW AT LEAST THIS FEELS NORMAL NOW CARTMAN AND CRAIG CAN BOTH HATE TWEEK
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS RETA INING ANYTHING
YEP THERE IT IS
THE PRO IS THAT YOU CAN ONLY USE WHAT YOU NEED
TRANSFORMATIONS ON CHARTS
WHICH IS A GREENFIELD TEAM THAT HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD NEW INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE CONTEXT OF AN EXISTING COMPANY
I WANT TALK ABOUT SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING BECAUSE YOU HAD THIS AS YOU SAID THIS POST ABOUT HOW WHAT WENT WRONG WITH FREECODECAMP SERVERS
AND
AND THE FASTEST CENTIPEDE THERE IS
NOT TERRIBLY INTERESTING NOT TO SAY THAT THERE ARE USE CASES PER SE AND HEY HOW MANY USERS DO I HAVE IN THIS GROUP OR HOW MANY USERS DO I HAVE IN THIS SYSTEM
SO THAT CHAT ROOM WAS ABSOLUTELY INSTRUMENTAL AND PEOPLE HELPING ME WITH THIS PROCESS WAS INSTRUMENTAL
THE MISS-POTENTIAL
I GUESS THE API
WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO
BUT FOR PROBLEMS THEMSELVES WORTH SOLVING
WHAT YOU DESCRIBED WITH THE UNIVERS ITY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU WENT THROUGH
SHOW-STOPPER FOR US
WHATEVER THE REASON THIS TRACHELOPHYLLUM ISN'T ALONE AMONG PROTISTS
SO WE THINK THAT'S PRETTY UNACCEPTABLE
THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE ROOM
WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE THE REQUIREMENT OF INTEGRATING WITH A BUNCH OF EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE ON A DIFFERENT DIMENSION
ADDING FIVE THOUSAND DOM NODES MAKES THINGS VERY SLOW
AND I'VE DONE WITH US FOR A VERY LONG TIME
SO
INCLUDING DROPBOX ADOBE COURSERA AND CRUISE AUTOMATION
BECAUSE IT IS FREE AND THERE ARE NO ADVERTISEMENTS
SO IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT YOU REALLY HATE ABOUT SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY
MANY A TAME SENTENCE CAN BE MADE LIVELY AND EMPHATIC BY SUBSTITUTING A TRANSITIVE IN THE ACTIVE VOICE FOR SOME SUCH PERFUNCTORY EXPRESSION AS THERE IS OR COULD BE HEARD WELL I'M GLAD TO HEAR FROM THE LAUGHTER THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE NOTED THAT
SO FAR
THEY DON'T WANT ME TO DOWNLOAD THE SOFTWARE I'M GOING TO DO IT
YOU CAN USE TRANSIFEX WITH IN-HOUSE TRANSLATION TEAMS LANGUAGE SERVICE PROVIDERS
WE ALSO EXPLORE SOME OF THE ARCHITECTURAL THEMES OF THUMBTACK
NOW NOTICE THAT THIS PASSAGE HAS THREE PASSIVE SENTENCES IN A ROW AND FOR GOOD REASON
SHE HAD A BETTER IDEA I SHOULD PUT A LOUISIANA STATE FLAG ON IT SO I CAN SEE IT
I'M NOT SURE
AND THEY EVEN RAISE TO THE FRONT HERE SO THAT'S THE THING WHEN YOU IMPLEMENT YOUR OWN OVERLAY YOU CAN IMPLEMENT STUFF LIKE
TEAMS TRUST PAGERDUTY TO HELP THEM DELIVER HIGH-QUALITY DIGITAL EXPERIENCES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS
THAT'S GOING TO REALLY MAKE THIS VISUALIZATION POP WHAT'S GOING TO STAND OUT THE MOST
I'M AVAILABLE
NOT EVEN THE STATE BIRD DOING SOMETHING HELPFUL THAT'S ACTUALLY A MYTH
WELL WE CAN THEN GO BACK BEFORE THE ADVENT OF RADIO AND TELEVISION
PLUS THE TEN MONTHS WE'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH
AND YOU CAN DO THIS REALLY EASILY IN THE API USING SOMETHING CALLED ENCODED POLYLINES
BUT WE'VE GOT THIS QUIRKY COMMUNITY
HEROKU HAS EARNED THE TRUST OF DEVELOPERS
SO WE'RE SUPPORTING RIGHT NOW KUBERNETES SECRET AND VAULT
BUT IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT LIKE NODE JS FOR EXAMPLE
MANIFOLD MAKES YOUR LIFE EASIER BY PROVIDING A SINGLE WORKFLOW TO ORGANIZE YOUR SERVICES
SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU DEPLOY A STATIC WEBSITE OR WHEN YOU RESPOND WITH THE HTTP CACHE HEADERS FROM YOUR DEPLOYMENT
I CONTINUE TO USE DIGITALOCEAN BECAUSE OF THE LOW FRICTION AND ATTENTION TO USER EXPERIENCE
LOGROCKET ALSO RECORDS CONSOLE LOGS JAVASCRIPT ERRORS
AND EVERY STUDENT WHO GOES THROUGH SPRINGBOARD IS PAIRED WITH A MENTOR
IT'S AT CLOUD SUPER COMPUTER
YOU ARE BY THE WAY CONSPICUOUS BY YOUR ABSENCE THANKS THANKS THAT'S GREAT
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO CONSTRUCT THE GEOCHART OBJECT
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO EASILY FI ND OUT WHO PUSHED CODE MOST RECENTLY SO THAT YOU CAN CONTACT THEM AND FI ND OUT HOW TO TROUBLESHOOT THE ISSUE VICTOROPS IS A COLLABORATIVE INCIDENT RESPONSE TOOL
THINGS AREN'T GOING TO CHANGE
WE NEED TO DO BETTER
WE DEPLOY THEM TO A CDN SO THAT YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT REGIONS AND YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT LATENCY TO YOUR END CUSTOMER
NOW AMAZON'S RECOMMENDATION ENGINE HASN'T FIGURE THAT OUT YET OUR RECOMMENDATION ENGINE DID
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT GL IMMER OF HOPE THAT YOU OR I MIGHT HAVE SEEING SOME GUY WHO LOOKS LIKE OUR DAD FOR EXAMPLE
SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY IS A GREAT WAY TO REACH TOP ENGINEERS
HOW HAS THE MARKET FOR CODING EDUCATION PRODUCTS CHANGED SINCE YOU STARTED FREECODECAMP
THERE'S VERY LITTLE RISK AND YOU MIGHT FIND YOURSELF IN A GREAT POSITION GETTING MULTIPLE ON-SITE INTERVIEWS FROM JUST ONE QUIZ AND A TRIPLEBYTE INTERVIEW
IT HAS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT NETWORKING FEATURES BUT TWO OF THEM IS OBVIOUSLY MUCH MUCH MUCH HIGHER THROUGHPUT
I JUST WANNA EAT MOSQUITOES OR FRUIT
IN OUR VERSION ONE POINT ONE AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE LINKS FOR EVERYTHING AT THE END
THAT DATA IS OURS
WHAT'S THE RUNTIME LOOP LOOK LIKE
SO INSTEAD OF REINVENTING THE WHEEL EACH TIME TRYING TO SEE WELL IS THERE A TOOL OR A LIBRARY OR STARTING POINT TO GO OFF OF AND THAT'S BEEN REALLY BENEFICIAL WITH OPEN SOURCE
IF YOU WANT TO SAY PLUG THAT INTO A MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEM
ARE BROKEN AND DISABLED WE THE PEOPLE NEED NOT ACCEPT OUR LIMITATIONS
SO IOBSERVABLE HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE
UNFORTUNATELY MICROSOFT DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT OUTSIDE OF REDMOND AND I AM STILL AND HAVE BEEN TIED TO NEW YORK CITY
SO THAT ACTUALLY WORKS EXTREMELY WELL
MOST OF THE TIME WE WILL FILTER THAT OUT THERE
OPERATORS DESCRIBED THEY'RE ALWAYS DESCRIBED IN THIS FORMAT SO THE IDEA HERE IS THAT THE TOP TWO THINGS ARE DATA STREAMS
THERE WE GO
WHICH IS A FABULOUS SERVICE IF YOU LIKE NUMBERPHILE VIDEOS YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO LIKE THIS
NOW ACCORDING TO THE SCENARIO ON THE OTHER HAND SIDE WE HAVE THE DESCRIPTIVISTS WHO DESCRIBE HOW PEOPLE DO SPEAK AND WRITE
DID YOU KNOW THAT BABE RUTH STRUCK OUT THE MOST TIMES OUT OF ANYBODY
THOSE ORGANISMS THEN BEGAN TO CONTORT AND TWIST TO THE SIDE
YOU CAN EASILY INTEGRATE WITH THE TOOLS THAT YOU ALREADY USE
AND SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS INSTEAD OF TRYING TO LIKE MAGICALLY INFER WHAT THIS CONFIGURATION IS FOR YOU
I KNOW WHAT IT'S DOING
BUT THE THING IS THERE YOU HAVE TO PRE-DECIDE THE BATCHES
YEAH SO BEYOND THAT
YOU GET YOUR STUFF WITH OBSERVABLES WHERE YOU CAN CATCH THE EXCEPTION
DATADOG INTEGRATES SEAMLESSLY WITH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING KUBERNETES AND DOCKER SO YOU CAN MONITOR YOUR ENTIRE CONTAINER CLUSTER IN ONE PLACE
WHAT WE ANNOUNCED THIS WEEK AT REINVENT IS THE GRAVITON TWO PROCESSOR
I WAS TWENTY SIX
WE ALSO HAVE MULTIPLE OTHER WAYS OF GETTING IN TOUCH ON PODSHEETS PODSHEETS IS AN OPEN SOURCE PODCAST HOSTING PLATFORM
TURNING A VERB OR AN ADJECTIVE INTO A NOUN
WHAT

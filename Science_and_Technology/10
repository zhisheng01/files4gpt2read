I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE THAT
DIGITALOCEAN LETS DEVELOPERS FOCUS ON WHAT THEY ARE BUILDING
MANY PEOPLE ARE LEARNING TO CODE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY
WE DON'T HAVE THE SEVEN YEARS OF TAX RETURNS
YOU CAN CHECK OUT SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM SLASH MESOSPHERE
UNIFIED SERVICE MESH
IT WOULD ONLY IMPACT THAT ARTIFACT
LIKE MANY OF THE SOFTWARE SERVICES THAT WE HAVE COVERED ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY
WHICH YOU CAN ACTUALLY ATTACH DEBUGGER
THESE APPLICATIONS OFTEN REQUIRE DATA WAREHOUSING GLUE CODE
YOU CAN GET BOTH OF THOSE THINGS BY GOING TO SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM SLASH DATADOG
YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD OF PAGERDUTY
IS THAT THE PROGRAMMING THAT THEY DID FELT FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM AT A LOWER LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION AND WITH LESS STRUCTURE THAN I FELT WAS APPROPRIATE
IT WILL DO ALL OF YOUR NPM OR TIP THINGS IF YOU'RE IN NODE OR PYTHON LANGUAGES
HAVE CLOSE TO FOUR THOUSAND MARKERS
YOU KNOW THEY'RE INCREDIBLY SCRAPPY AND THEY SORT OF CREATE THE FOUNDATION OF
A LOT OF UNCHARTED TERRITORIES AND THIS TIMELINE REALLY HELPS TO SHOW YOU
THE DECADES AHEAD WILL SEE DRAMATIC ADVANCES IN DISEASE PREVENTION
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A DESIGNER TO GET GREAT ANALYTICS IN YOUR PRODUCT
SOMEONE HAD CREATED ONE FOR OCAML FOR EXAMPLE
THIS LINE IS AT YOU KNOW SOME HIGHER ZOOM LEVEL AND AS WE ZOOM IN
LOOK THEM UP
OH GREAT MY MOUSE CURSOR DISAPPEARED
THE NUMBERS LOOK PRETTY SCARY
PODCASTING IS AS EASY AS BLOGGING
THE ORGANISM WOULD TEMPORARILY REVERSE THE MOVEMENT OF ITS CILIA
WE ARE BUILDING PODSHEETS WITH THE LEARNINGS FROM SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY
WE'LL JUST KIND OF LIKE LAY THIS OUT AND THEN WE'LL DO SOME TRANSITIONS AND THAT COOL STUFF LET'S ZOOM OUT THE TIMELINE A LITTLE BIT
LET'S IMPORT
AND THEN THE BOTTOM ONE IS WHAT YOUR SUBSCRIBER SEES
THE BIONIC LIMB OUTPUTS HIGH TORQUES AND POWERS TO LIFT THE PERSON INTO THE WALKING STRIDE COMPARABLE TO HOW MUSCLES WORK IN THE CALF REGION
SO THAT'S JUST SAYING
BUT I WOULD NEED THIS DOWN HERE SO WE CAN FADE TO BLACK
WE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON PRODUCING A TOOL THAT HELPS PEOPLE KIND OF UNDERSTAND AND GROK THE UNIVERSE OF CODE THAT'S RELEVANT TO THEM AND I THINK INCREASINGLY FOR MOST DEVELOPERS
CENTURYLINK HAD A PRODUCT MANY YEARS AGO
IS GOT TO BE PARAMOUNT AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S NOT VERY USEFUL IF IT'S GOING TO TAKE ME A MONTH TO ANSWER ONE QUESTION
IN THE CASE OF MY CATALOG SERVICE
CAN ADAPT TO WHATEVER APPLICATION YOU NEED DASHBOARDS COMMUNICATION KANBAN BOARDS ISSUE TRACKING
YOU'RE GETTING A FEEDBACK
I THINK THERE'S STILL ABSOLUTELY A NEED FOR SPECIALIZED COMPONENTS WHETHER AGAIN THOSE ARE HARDWARE SOFTWARE ON-PREM CLOUD
WHEREAS THE ELSE IF INDEX
SO WE CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON
OKAY SO LET'S SAVE THIS
OH MY GOSH THIS IS GONNA BE AMAZING
ABOUT THE DYNAM ICS OF CREATING SOFTWARE AND MAINTAINING SOFTWARE DURING DEPLOYMENTS
IT'S REASONABLE BUT IT'S NOT THAT HIGH
POLITICS
AND THAT'S NOT A GREAT SITUATION
SO LET'S GO INTO THAT ZEIT ARCHITECTURE
WE DE SIGNATURE ALREADY
AS A STUDENT RATHER THAN AS AN ACADEMIC
AND GRAPHS ARE A BIT WEIRD RIGHT
THERE'S VERY LITTLE RISK AND YOU MIGHT FIND YOURSELF IN A GREAT POSITION GETTING MULTIPLE ONSITE INTERVIEWS FROM JUST ONE QUIZ AND A TRIPLEBYTE INTERVIEW
RIGHT NOW
BUT WHAT IS MY OPERATIONAL COST MANAGING THAT
GIVE US FEEDBACK MAYBE TRY THE DEMOS
SO I SPENT
SO LET'S TURN ON THAT BROKEN VERSION SEND SOME TRAFFIC TO IT AND SHOW HOW ISTIO CAN HELP
TO FLOUT THEM IS TO DUMB DOWN LITERATE CULTURE DEGRADE THE LANGUAGE
THERE ARE SO MANY MISTAKES
SO GUYS CAN COME TO IGNITE NOW
VETTERY IS AN ONLINE HIRING MARKETPLACE THAT CONNECTS HIGHLY QUALIFIED WORKERS WITH TOP COMPANIES
YOU CANNOT TRUST THAT MACHINE TO DO ANYTHING AFTERWARDS
AND A HORIZONTAL EXPANSION THAT HAS BEEN SO WEL L-EXECUTED THAT YOU HAVE BASICALLY THE BIGGEST PROGRAMMING CHANNEL ON YOUTUBE
THE NICE THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT I THINK THAT THERE ARE FAR LESS CASES WHERE YOU'RE SCARED OF ANOTHER ORGANIZATION DRIVING THE UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGY
YOU'RE DESCRIBING A LOT OF TRENDS HERE
THE INFRASTRUCTURE PRIMITIVES TEND TO BE VERY VERY LOW LEVEL
I HAVE A LITTLE DEMO HERE
THAT'S THE BIGGEST BOTTLENECK RIGHT NOW
AND SO NATURALLY
WELL WHAT DO WE DO WITH THESE MORE CONTESTED USAGE ERRORS
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT RELIABLE ENOUGH
IF YOU WERE TO CREATE THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF THAT TYPE OF PERSON THAT WOULD BE VITALIC TRUE VITALIC IS JUST THIS GUY WHO'S JUST BRILLIANT AND HE SEEMS TO HAVE A VERY CLEAR AND KIND MORAL COMPASS
THEN BREAKING THAT DOWN
SO WE ADD OUR TWO COLUMNS
BUT ALSO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT DEVOPS AND APPLICATION FOCUSED DEPLOYMENTS
THE STORY OF ADRIANNE HASLET-DAVIS
TRIPLEBYTE TAKES ENGINEERS SERIOUSLY AND DOES NOT WASTE THEIR TIME
I MEAN I SAID DUMB BUT THERE'RE TONS OF SMARTS IN THERE THAT COULD READ THE METADATA COMING IN OFF OF THE DATA TYPE AND JUST PROVIDE ALL THESE FUNCTIONALITY
SO NOW WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN MAKE LOOK UP CALLS AGAINST A LOCAL DATABASE
YOU'LL SEE CHROME IS HANGING BECAUSE MY BACK END SERVICE IS HANGING AT THIS POINT
MANY OF YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT THAT WAS AN ERA IN WHICH TEENAGERS SPOKE IN ARTICULATE PARAGRAPHS
BUT IT'S THE SLOWEST ACCESS TIME
I KNOW THAT KUBERNETES FOR EXAMPLE HAS A SID WINDOWS
SO NOW IT SHOULD GO IN FROM BLACK TO THE TITLE WITH THIS WIPE
NORMAL
THE PROBLEM WITH TRADITIONAL STYLE ADVICE IS THAT IT CONSISTS OF AN ARBITRARY LIST OF DOS AND DON'TS BASED ON THE TASTES AND PEEVES OF THE AUTHORS
OKAY NOW THAT WE'VE GOT THIS INFRASTRUCTURE STABILIZED
LIFE IN THE MICROCOSMOS COMES WITH ITS OWN CHOICES THOUGH
IF YOU WEREN'T WORKING ON FREECODECAMP
BECAUSE THE DEVELOPERS WHO FIND THEMSELVES IN THIS POSITION WELL
SO TODAY YOU HAVE CLICK STREAMS OF DATA OR FAST INCOMING DATA ABOUT SENSORS FROM A SELF-DRIVING CAR
TEACHING HOW TO CODE IS HARD
FOR EACH SERVICE THEY MIGHT HAVE LOTS OF PREFERENCES LET'S SAY YOU KNOW
TRADITIONAL FIELDS OF STUDY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND IN SO DOING INEVITABLY THEY WILL MEET AND CREATE NEW DISCIPLINES
MAPR CAN LEVERAGE THE HIGH VOLUMES OF DATA PRODUCED WITHIN YOUR COMPANY
I'M GETTING THE
EVERYONE CAN SEE THAT OUR CHILDREN IS LEARNING IS UNGRAMMATICAL AND THEREFORE IS OUR CHILDREN LEARNING IS ALSO UNGRAMMATICAL
WHATEVER THE OTHER SYSTEMS GIVE YOU
SO YOU'LL PROBABLY HEAR THIS AFTER THE FACT BUT TOMORROW

WE WERE LUCKY WE DID WE SHOWED UP EVERY DAY FOR A WHILE
AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S A ONE-STOP SHOP FOR EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO BUY IN ORDER TO BE THE BEST HIPSTER THAT YOU CAN BE
ON A PREVIOUS EPISODE RYAN AND I DISCUSSED THE FIELD OF PROGRAMMING EDUCATION
BECAUSE AS I SAID BEFORE
IN THIS CASE IT WOULD BE REALLY USEFUL IF I COULD JUST CLICK ON THIS
GOVERNMENT
YOU CAN START A FREE TRIAL TODAY AND DATADOG WILL SEND YOU A T-SHIRT FOR FREE AT SOFTWARE ENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM SLASH DATADOG
YOU CAN COME AND BE PART OF THE COMMUNITY THAT IS JUST AS PASSIONATE AS YOU ARE ABOUT DEVOPS
AND SO IT CALLS OUR CALLBACK DRAWSTUFF
A BUSINESS CAN FIND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF MONEY TO BE SAVED PER MONTH
BUSINESS MEDIA AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
AND YOU'RE ABLE TO SHOW
YOU'RE A MEDIA COMPANY
MUCH EASIER TO GET I DON'T KNOW
OR YOUR COMPILATION TIMES EVEN GET VERY VERY LONG BECAUSE YOU JUST HAVE EVERYTHING IN ONE
YOU NEED EVERYTHING THAT'S IN YOUR FIRST ONE TO DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR SECOND ONE
DEFINITELY BE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN TOUCH AND INTERACT WITH
WHEN SHE LOST HER LIMB IN THE BOSTON TERRORIST ATTACK
YOU MENTIONED COMPLEXITY

WHAT ARE THE ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS FOR TRADING APPLICATIONS
THEY KNOW THEIR STUFF AND THEY RUN A GREAT ORGANIZATION IN MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE G TWO I HAS LINKED ME UP WITH EXPERIENCED ENGINEERS THAT CAN FIT MY BUDGET AND THE G TWO I STAFF ARE FRIENDLY AND EASY TO WORK WITH
SO WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THIS
MANIFOLD WILL KEEP YOU ON THE CUTTING-EDGE SO YOU CAN FOCUS ON BUILDING YOUR PROJECT RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON PROBLEMS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN SOLVED
ANY FUNCTION A BLANK SLATE FOR WHICH TO CREATE
ACCORDING TO THE GARTNER ANALYST FIRM
LOGROCKET LETS YOU REPLAY WHAT USERS DO ON YOUR SITE HELPING TO REPRODUCE BUGS AND FIX ISSUES FASTER
I AM SECOND OLDEST
IT'S IN KNOWING WHICH ASPECTS OF CONVENTION TO KEEP IN PLACE IN WHICH ASPECTS TO DISCARD
AND I BELIEVE IT HAS ADVANCED QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THEN
WHETHER YOU ARE A NEW COMPANY BUILDING YOUR FIRST PRODUCT
MEMORY OPTIMIZED DROPLETS MANAGED DATABASES MANAGED KUBERNETES AND MANY MORE PRODUCTS
AND WE'RE DONE
WE BELIEVE THE BEST SOLUTION TO PODCASTING WILL BE OPEN SOURCE
AND THIS IS REALLY NICE HERE WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS THAT THEY GEOCODED THE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM EVERYONE IN AMERICA AND THEN PLOTTED THEM ON THE MAP
I HAVE SCARVES I CAN'T WEAR
WE HAVE THE TEXT CHANGE HERE WHICH IS WHEN THEY'RE TYPING IN THE USERNAME AND WE HAVE THE PASSWORD HERE WHEN THEY'RE TYPING IN THE PASSWORD
HERE'S A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF CLUSTERING WHICH IS AUTHORMAPPER
JACKSON HAS BEEN PULLED BACK INTO THE WORLD OF CRYPTOCURRENCY
SPOILER ALERT
THERE YOU HAVE IT AROUND FIVE SECONDS BEFORE THE USER CAN ACTUALLY START INTERACTING WITH THE MAP
IN THAT FUTURE
I DO NOT THINK IT MEANS WHAT YOU THINK IT MEANS
GO TO SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM SLASH MEETUP IF YOU WANT TO REGISTER FOR AN UPCOMING MEETUP
THE TECHMEME RIDE HOME PODCAST HAS BEEN ONE OF SILICON VALLEY'S FAVORITES
IN THE PAST WE MIGHT HAVE USED CIRCUIT BREAKER LIBRARIES
WE COULD FIND THEM ON OUR BASKETBALL TEAM
YOU USED THE TERM SELF-DESCRIBING CONFIGURATION CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS
WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO US I LOOKED THIS UP
AND LET'S IMPORT OUR LOVELY TITLE CREATION
THEY HAVE TO TEST FOR IT
SO I'M A HUGE FAN OF THAT ASPECT OF THEIR MODEL
THEN I GET REALLY SAD AND CRY
AND IF MY CODEBASE IS SUFFICIENTLY LARGE
WHY WOULD THEY BUY A SOFTWARE CONSULTING FIRM
AND WE HAVE OUR MERCATOR PROJECTION OF THE UNITED STATES
WHAT'S YOUR BIRTH ORDER
RESOURCE CONSUMPTION AND DEPLOYMENT IN REAL TIME FILTER TO A SPECIFIC DOCKER IMAGE OR DRILL DOWN BY KUBERNETES SERVICE TO GET FINE-GRAINED VISIBILITY INTO YOUR CONTAINER INFRASTRUCTURE
NOT NECESSARILY FROM THE COST ASPECT
BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE BUILDING OFF OF OTHERS AND OTHERS WILL LEVERAGE THAT
BUT I'M ALSO A CUSTOMER AND I LOVE WHAT THEY'RE DOING
IN PARTICULAR YOU GIVE US THE BUILD STEPS OF YOUR CODE AND THESE SERVERLESS FUNCTIONS THAT YOU CAN DEFINE IN ANY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
AND WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME WORRYING ABOUT THE REDRAW
SO ONE THING I WANTED TO MAKE SURE DO IN THE PODCAST IS TELL EVERYBODY ABOUT A BIG MOVEMENT THAT WE'RE LAUNCHING
WE WANT TO PRESENT IT IN A NON-TECHNICAL WAY
THE LUNATICS ARE RUNNING THE ASYLUM
THIS SYSTEM THAT IS EVERYWHERE
DON'T WORRY I'M NOT SOME KIND OF NUT JOB THAT THINKS THIS STUFF IS REAL I REALIZE THIS IS A SCIENCE FICTION TV SHOW
YOU GIVE THEM THEIR DATA
THE NOTION OF RUNNING UNIT TESTS IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT
CLASSIC PROSE NARRATES ONGOING EVENTS WE SEE AGENTS WHO PERFORM ACTIONS THAT AFFECT OBJECTS
COOL
IT'S THE GOVERNMENT'S WAY OF ESSENTIALLY RE LIEVING PARENTS OF THEIR KIDS FOR THE DAY SO THE PARENTS CAN GO AND WORK
AND HOW DOES THIS FIT INTO A CICD WORKFLOW
I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT SOMEONE IN ZOMBIE MAKEUP WITHOUT BEING REALLY ACTUALLY AFRAID I DON'T KNOW I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WE VERY EARLY ON DECIDED THAT WE WANTED EVERYTHING TO RUN CLIENT-SIDE
ULTIMATELY REALLY WITH THESE THINGS WE DON'T WANT THEM TO MAKE A DECISION
IF YOU ARE LISTENING TO THIS PODCAST YOU ARE PROBABLY SERIOUS ABOUT SOFTWARE
THE WORLD IS CRAZY
CORRECT
SORT OF BUT NOT REALLY
WHICH HAVE NO CONNECTION WITH OTHER REGIONS

SO OVER THAT TIME SINCE I HAD LEFT WALL STREET AND SINCE I JOINED BLUE METAL
IF YOU ARE BUILDING A COMPANY IN THE DEVELOPER TOOLING SPACE OR SOMETHING RELATED TO INFRASTRUCTURE
YOU LOVE IT TOO
STRONGER AND BETTER TECHNOLOGY HAD ELIMINATED MY DISABILITY
YOU CAN THINK OF LANGUAGE AS AN APP FOR CONVERTING A WEB OF THOUGHTS INTO A STRING OF WORDS
MESSAGING STUFF THAT WE SHOULD DISCUSS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
I FEEL LIKE I'VE HEARD THAT STORY A COUPLE TIMES AT LEAST ONCE TALKING TO PEOPLE FROM UBER
DICE HAS THE RESOURCES THAT YOU NEED
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

INCLUDING I E SIX
ADRIANNE BREATHES AND LIVES DANCE

AND WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS JUST A SPREADSHEET WITH A LITTLE BIT OF DATA
HOW DO WE STOP IT

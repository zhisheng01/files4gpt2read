AND SO WITH THE ACTIONS API YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO IN AND ADD MORE INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS TO YOUR TOOL TIPS
THE REAL QUESTION IS HOW MUCH POTENTIAL TO DO GOOD IN THIS WOR LD ARE WE FOREGOING BY BEING SO UNDERCAPITALIZED
THAT COMPLETELY DISREGARDS THE HUMAN ELEMENT OF HOW WE GRAPPLE WITH LEARN ING
ENGINEERS DON'T LIKE SACRIFICING THEIR TIME TO DO PHONE SCREENS
PEOPLE DON'T SIT DOWN AND START MEMORIZING EQUATIONS
CUCURBITOLOGY IS THE STUDY YOU'RE SO NOT EVEN READY FOR THIS
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO LEARNS VERY QUICKLY AND CAN PRODUCE HIGH-QUALITY CODE AT A FAST PACE
THE SIMPLE TEXT SHOULD BE ABLE TO READ PICTURES
I WOULD HAVE TO BASICALLY PULL EVERY DAY OF THE ENTIRE LAST NINETY DAYS AND THEN BRING IT ALL INTO MY SYSTEM AND THEN RUN AN AGGREGATION ON IT
AND THEN NOW YOU START WIRING UP YOUR NEW ONES
YOU WANT THIS DOWN HERE
AND YET IT'S NOT HAPPENING ANYWHERE NEAR AS FAST AS WE WANT IT TO
WHERE YOU'RE DOING MORE OF A PROTOCOL TYPE OPERATION
CUSTOM OPERATING SYSTEMS AND STREAMING MEDIA
ADJUST THAT
TEACHER
THE STORY THERE ACTUALLY STARTS WITH REALLY LONG SALE CYCLES WITH OUR CUSTOMERS
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY COMPILE YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE DAGSTER THE SOFTWARE ABSTRACTION WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF AIRFLOW
PREMIERE'S NOT SHOWING UP IN THERE OKAY
ALL I'M DOING HERE IS ADDING ANOTHER OPTION
SHE IS A QUICK STUDY AND HAS BEEN ABLE TO EDUCATE HERSELF IN VIRTUALLY ANY AREA THAT INTERESTS HER
IT'S JUST THEY PAID TO RUN THE PROGRAM
AND FOR AUDIOBOOKS
LOGI ANALYTICS HAS BEEN A SPONSOR OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY FOR A WHILE AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO HAVE THEM SO THANKS TO LOGI ANALYTICS
I COULD NOT AGREE MORE WITH WHAT YOU ARE SAYING HERE
CONTROL OVER THAT DATA OR RATHER GOVERNMENT CONTROL OVER HOW THAT DATA IS USED IN ACCESS IS PARAMOUNT
FOR ONE THING
SUPPORTING KIND OF NEW PATTERN MATCHING SYNTAXES BEYOND REGEX
AW THAT'S SO EXCITING
YOU GET THE STACK DOMS YOU LOOK AT HOW LONG OBJECTS ARE LIVING
BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD JUST USE IT AS THEIR GO TO TOOL FOR DIVING INTO AN UNFAMILIAR PART OF GOOGLE'S CODE
SO THERE'S ALMOST THIS TRADEOFF BETWEEN
THANK FOR LISTENING AND THANK YOU TO GITLAB
YEAH FORCE QUIT IS ALSO NOT SHOWING UP RESTART MY RESTART SHORTCUT ON THE KEYBOARD IS ALSO NOT RESPONDING NOT SURE IF THAT'S NORMAL THOUGH
WHICH WORKS AS FOLLOWS THE SUBJECT CLOSES HIS EYES
IMAGINE A FUTURE WHERE CLOTHING IS STIFF AND SOFT WHERE YOU NEED IT
THIS EVENT WAS DISCUSSED BY TONY IN TODAY'S EPISODE
STUPID QUESTION WHAT IS A PELICAN IS A PELICAN ONLY THE KIND THAT HAVE THE PURSE ATTACHED TO THEIR FACE
AND QCON IS A PLACE WHERE SENIOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS AND TEAM LEADERS AND MANAGERS AND SENIOR LEADERS
EVEN HIGHLY TECHNICAL SITUATIONS CAN BE EXPLAINED IN A WAY THAT PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND
THE BROKEN VERSION SIMULATES THE KIND OF ISSUES I'VE SEEN IN THE PAST WHERE SERVICE TAKES TOO LONG TO RESPOND
AS THE USER TYPES WE HAVE THE LOGIN BUTTON CLICK WE HAVE THE CANCEL BUTTON CLICK AND WE HAVE LIKE THE WEB REQUEST SO WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY FIVE DIFFERENT EVENTS
AND THEN WE'LL SEE IF YOU QUALIFY
WHERE I DO THINK IT'S WORTH IT IF YOU THINK OF A DEVELOPER WHO GETS A NEW CLUSTER AS A SANDBOX FOR EXAMPLE AND THEY START BUILDING THEIR APP
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT SO THERE'S EVEN LESS TO HELP EMPOWER THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF WEEDING
IT'S FLEXIBLE
AT THIS THROUGHPUT
AND I HOPE YOU REALLY GET A GOOD CHANCE TO ENJOY ALL OF NEXT
SIMILAR TO THE ERROR MESSAGE RETURNED BY A CALCULATOR WHEN YOU TRY TO DIVIDE ONE BY ZERO
BUT EVEN IF THE DECISION WAS EASY THE STEPS IT TOOK TO EXECUTE THAT CHOICE THE INFORMATION YOU NEEDED TO GATHER
BUT AFTER PEOPLE STUCK AROUND SO THE BRIEF HISTORY OF FREECODECAMP AND I CAN GO MUCH FARTHER INTO MY PERSONAL HISTORY LATER WHICH I THINK IS RE LEVANT I HAVE NEVER REALLY TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE
IS THAT COMPANIES NO CONTINGENCY
AND THEN THE FUNGUS TAKES OVER ITS BEHAVIOR
WHICH WILL AUTOMATICALLY FIGURE OUT
FROM ONE SIDE OF THEIR POUCH TO THE OTHER YES
I'M GOING TO TAKE TWO COPIES OF THIS S TWO
I QUICKLY REALIZED THAT THE ARTIFICIAL PART OF MY BODY IS MALLEABLE ABLE TO TAKE ON ANY FORM
OP ED IN WHICH HE WAS TALKING ABOUT A COLLEGE REUNION HE WROTE CHECKING INTO THE HOTEL IT WAS NICE TO SEE A FEW OF MY OLD CLASSMATES IN THE LOBBY
STILL WORKS TODAY
AND HE JOINS THE SHOW FOR A SPECIAL EPISODE ABOUT HIS BACK STORY AND THE JOURNEY TO BUILDING THE BEST PLACE ON THE INTERNET FOR A NEW PROGRAMMER TO BEGIN
IT'S JUST PUTTING ON THE MAP AND THEN HOWEVER WE RENDER IT IS HOW WE RENDER IT AND YOU CAN'T CONTROL IT
LET'S DO A PAGE TURN
THERE WE GO YEAH
THEY HAVE TONS OF CONTRIBUTORS WITH VARYING INTERESTS
LET'S TALK ABOUT EXACTLY HOW WE CAN MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT PEOPLE WILL DO THE THING THAT YOU WANT
THAT'S A STRONG SIGN OF ADAPTION
IT'S AMAZING
FOR THE PURPOSE OF CLARITY
I AM OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE I THINK ACTUALLY IF WE GO BACK TO OUR ROOTS AND SAY THE AMERICAN DREAM IS A REAL THING AND IT CAN HAPPEN
TITLE
OH THIS MIGHT BE A TWO POINT FIVE GIG DISC I THINK I SAID FOUR EARLIER IT MIGHT BE TWO AND A HALF OR SOMETHING WE HAVE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED MEGABYTES AVAILABLE THOUGH SO THAT'S PLENTY
AND IN THIS DIRECTION YOU SEE HOW THE EFFECT OF SURFACE TENSION SMOOTHS OUT THESE SHAPES
I ALSO LEARNED THAT NOT NECESSARILY INTERESTED IN DIRECTLY BEING A SALESPERSON
DATADOG INTEGRATES SEAMLESSLY WITH CONTAINER TECHNOLOGIES LIKE DOCKER AND KUBERNETES SO YOU CAN MONITOR YOUR ENTIRE CONTAINER CLUSTER IN REAL-TIME
MOONLIGHT DOES NOT CHARGE YOU A FINDER'S FEE
IF YOU TURN TO A DICTIONARY
THAT'S ONE OPTION
MOST BROWSERS FIVE HUNDRED DIVS IS NOT THAT BAD IS NOT PARTICULARLY BAD
THE SECOND THING IS THAT MACHINE LEARNING RUNNING ON TOP OF THAT
WHICH IS DESIGNED TO PRESENT SHORT READABLE SUMMARIES OF RESEARCH FOR THE BENEFIT OF COGNITIVE SCIENTISTS KEEPING UP WITH ONE ANOTHER'S WORK
IF YOU'RE BUILDING OUT OR STARTING TO LOOK AT THAT LARGER PLATFORM SERVICE MESH YOU'RE LOOKING AT CLUSTER LEVEL INTEGRATION
IT REALLY HELPED US TIGHTEN UP OUR FEEDBACK LOOPS
AT THAT POINT WE WANT TO PULL IN SAFE BROWSING SEND THE CONTENT TO SAFE BROWSING
WHERE FOR I'D SAY LIKE NINETY
THE NERVE THEN ATTACHES TO CELLS
GIT BECAME THE INEVITABLE TECHNOLOGY AND THEREFORE
SO WARNINGS ULTIMATELY
BECOME A SPONSOR OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY AND SUPPORT THE SHOW WHILE GETTING YOUR COMPANY INTO THE EARS OF TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DEVELOPERS AROUND THE WORLD
OR TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO YOUR MODEL MORE GENERALLY
ABIGAIL RENNEMEYER SHE'S OUT IN PORTLAND AND SHE IS THE PRIMARY EDITOR FOR THE FREECODECAMP PUBLICATION
A TON OF CONTEXT IS LOST AND THEY DON'T HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL BASE OF INFRASTRUCTURE ON WHICH THEY CAN OPERATE IN A TRULY UNIFIED WAY
SO OUR PICT FILES ARE THE TITLE GRAPHICS AND THESE FILES ARE APPLE VIDEO DOCUMENTS
SO THIS IS SORT OF HOW THE PLATFORM COMES TO LIFE
YOU SEE A STEEL SPHERE ATTRACTING THE FERROFLUID HERE
LET'S CONTINUE ROUTE
BIONICS EXPLORES THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN BIOLOGY AND DESIGN AS YOU CAN SEE
YOU CAN SEE HAPPENED THE SECOND WE GOT ENGAGED
OKAY
NONE OF THE DICTIONARIES SAY THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH A SPLIT INFINITIVE
OK WELL IF THERE'S NOT I'M HAPPY TO STICK AROUND FOR A COUPLE MINUTES

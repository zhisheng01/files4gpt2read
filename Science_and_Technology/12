HEY EVERYONE SHOULD BE BUILDING A BILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY
THERE'S NO STUDENT DEBT THERE'S A GUARANTEED JOB AT THE END ITS HYPER-LOCAL SO WE LITERALLY HIRED PEOPLE FROM YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD
WHEN YOU HAVE A SOLUTION TO MANAGE FEATURE FLAGS AT SCALE
SUBJECTS TAUGHT IN A FULLY-INTERAC TIVE CLIENT-SIDE TESTED WAY
AND THEN ONCE THAT COMES IN
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY HEARD SOMEONE SAY THAT THAT IS AWESOME
I WANTED TO ACTUALLY ORDER AN UBER
YOUR WELCOME
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS FIRST PURSUED BY HEROKU
BECAUSE AIRFLOW IS A VERY POPULAR TOOL THAT IS USED TO DEFINE DAGS COMMONLY USED FOR DATA ENGINEERING
HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE THE SCALE
THERE'S PLENTY THAT YOU CAN DO WITHOUT WRITING A LOT OF CODE
YOU TRIED TO PUT TEN THOUSAND MARKERS ON THE MAP
I'M NOT TERRIFIED OF THE BOAT I'M TERRIFIED OF DAMAGING THE BOAT
SO ONE OF THEM IS THAT THE STANDARD WAY THAT WE DEPLOY APPLICATIONS IS BECOMING GLOBAL
THAT'S THE IDEA
AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL IT'S USEFUL FOR AND IF YOU LOOK AT GREENLAND IT'S GIANT IT'S BIGGER THAN AFRICA
BUT SOMEBODY ELSE DID
SO WE HAVE LESS CONFIDENCE HERE
YEAH BUT IF YOU SHRINK IT DOWN PLAY IT
OH YEAH IT IS PICKING UP TWO DISPLAYS CAUSE I DO HAVE TWO CARDS IN HERE I JUST DON'T HAVE TWO MONITORS HOOKED UP
IT'S SPRAW LING
TO PUBLIC HEALTH ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE IN MEDICAL SCIENCE AND SCIENCE OVERALL IS DOUBLING EVERY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS TECHNOLOGY IS INCREASING AT A COMPARABLE RATE BETWEEN THEM
BUT THE ONE THAT THEY ARGUE THAT INFECTS MOST ACADEMIC PROSE IS ONE THEY CALL POST-MODERN OR SELF-CONSCIOUS STYLE
DROVE THE ADOPTION OF GITHUB
MEANING THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY UNTIL YOU SECURE A JOB IN MACHINE LEARNING
SO WE CAN ENRICH OUR MODEL
AT WHICH POINT
THERE MAY BE VERY STRICT SECURITY POLICIES IN PLACE THAT SAY
UNLESS YOU WANT TO OF COURSE
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO BACK AND EDIT SHAKESPEARE WHEN HE WROTE WE ARE SUCH STUFF AS DREAMS ARE MADE ON
WE CAN DO MORE WITH OUR DATA
SO WE ROLLED WITH THE PUNCHES AND LET THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY WHILE SEEING THE GLASS AS HALF FULL
AND IF YOU TAKE SOME OF THESE STEPS YOU'LL BE ABLE TO START REDUCING THE ANNOYANCE
YOU CAN DISCOVER THE BEST SERVICES FOR YOUR PROJECTS IN THE MANIFOLD MARKETPLACE OR BRING YOUR OWN AND MANAGE THEM ALL IN ONE DASHBOARD
SO WHY WOULD SOMEBODY DO THAT
LIKE ME
YOU ARE CONTINUALLY LEARNING AND UPDATING YOUR SKILLS
BASICALLY GLUE THIS TYPE OF APPLICATION TOGETHER TO ONE APPLICATION
WE'RE GONNA KEEP TRYING TO DO THE WORK FOR YOU
IN MY CASE IT'S A LONG TERM THING
SO WE WANT TO ROTATE CERTIFICATES BETWEEN SERVICES EVERY HOUR OR EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR WHATEVER THE BUSINESS POLICY IS THERE
SO THE ABILITY TO FORCE THAT THAT POLICY FOLLOW THE APPLICATION EVEN IF KUBERNETES DECIDES TO SPIN UP A NEW SET OF SERVICES
I BELIEVE IT'S THREE CHARACTERS OKAY
AND WHAT CHANGES THE LEAF COLOR
AND WE STUDIED HOW THEY MOVE
THIS IS IT
A LOT OF BIRDERS MIGHT WORRY ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THEY BRING WATER
SO SUBSCRIBE IS EFFECTIVELY INVOKING THAT TOP GUY
WHY IS IT WORKING SO WELL WHY IS IT SO FAST THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO PROJECT AS A PRODUCT AS A SERVICE
THESE CHARTS WILL OUTPUT TO SVG WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING TO MAKE THEM BETTER
OH SOMETHING HAPPENED THERE
TO MAKE E C TWO SUCCESSFUL
EVENT NOTIFICATION PATTERN YOUR BASIC OBSERVER PATTERN
THANK YOU TO REPLICATED FOR BEING A SPONSOR OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY AND YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF AT REPLICATED DOT COM AND GET A FREE THIRTY DAY TRIAL
SO WE KNOW THAT FOR EXAMPLE ALL THESE FICTITIOUS CHARACTERS APPEAR IN AN EPISODE
I KIND OF BECAME THIS AMATEUR BIRDER LIKE I ACTUALLY GO OUT WITH MY BINOS AND MY FIELD GUIDE AND I REALLY TRY TO IDENTIFY THESE BIRDS AND IT'S SO MUCH FUN
HUGE CONGRATULATIONS TO THE AUTHORS
AND AS A RESULT USERS HAVE NO WAY OF UNDERSTANDING AND ASSIMILATING THE ADVICE
THEY ARE ALSO KNOWN AS THE PURISTS STICKLERS PEDANTS PEEVERS SNOBS SNOOTS
THIS GENTLEMAN DOES NOT HAVE ANY LEG CONDITION ANY DISABILITY
I THINK EDUCATION COMPANIES LIKE TREEHOUSE AND OTHERS ARE REALIZING
YOU CAN REGISTER TODAY AT SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM SLASH GITLABCOMMIT
THIS WAS AN ENJOYABLE EPISODE FOR ME BECAUSE I AM FRIENDS WITH QUINCY
WHAT WE DO IS WE SAY OKAY
SOME OF THE ADVICE IS BAFFLING
BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT RATE OF CHANGE AND ARE STORED IN DIFFERENT PLACES
I MEAN THIS TO ME SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED A MILLION TIMES WHY ISN'T THIS SOMETHING YOU CAN JUST TAKE OFF THE SHELF WHY DO YOU HAVE TO ROLL YOUR OWN
YOU'RE MAKING IT HARD FOR YOURSELF
OK
SO ALREADY WE'RE QUITE CLOSE TO IT
IT'S KIND OF BUILT TO RE INFORCE THIS
THAT'S NOT COOL ONE OF THEM'S BOGARTING A LIVE CHICKEN FOOT AND THE OTHER'S DOING ALL THE RUSE WORK
SO THIS IS THE SITUATION WITH VECTOR GRAPHICS ON THE WEB
AS I MENTIONED ONE OF THEM IS THERE'S A COHESIVE DEVELOPMENT STORY YOU JUST CLONE THE REPO AND THERE'S ONE SCRIPT OR ONE INSTRUCTION RUN TO MAKE EVERYTHING WORK LOCALLY
DOESN'T MATTER
BUT ALSO CHARACTERISTICS ON HOW THEY RECEIVE TRAFFIC
THIS DIAGRAM SHOWS FUNDAMENTALLY HOW THE BIONIC LIMB IS CONTROLLED
IT'S IN SOME WAYS VERY SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT COMPANIES ARE DEALING WITH TODAY IN TERMS OF STREAMING DATA
WHAT WE GET IS WE GET A STORY OF HOW THE GOOGLE VISUALIZATION DEVELOPMENT TEAM IS FOLLICALLY CHALLENGED
IF YOU CAN SUPPORT US
THE ONLY CONCLUSION WE COULD DRAW
AND WHAT WE'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT TODAY WAS GOOGLE SAFE BROWSING
I THINK DEVOPS IS KEY TO OPEN-SOURCE PROJECT ESPECIALLY TO HELP MITIGATE BURNOUT AND
THAT IT'S HANDLED VERY SORT OF BY DESIGN
EXHAUS T
OKAY SO LET'S GO TO OUR APPLICATIONS
AND IN THAT WAY THE STENTORS COULD ATTEMPT TO EVADE THE CARMINE WHILE STILL FOCUSING ON WHAT'S TRULY IMPORTANT FOOD
BAD WRITERS WORK BACKWARDS FROM THEIR OWN KNOWLEDGE
ALLOWS YOU TO DO THIS FOR LINUX MAC AND WINDOWS BUILD AGENTS
DRIVE AN HOUR TO OUR FIELD SITE
AND SAFE BROWSING FOR GOOGLE IS BUILT INTO MOST OF OUR PRODUCTS
THERE WE GO
THERE WERE A FEW OBVIOUS THINGS AS I STARTED TO TALK TO PEOPLE AND OBSERVE THE WAY THEY WORK
AND SOME PROJECTIONS REQUIRE YOU TO SPECIFY THESE PARALLELS
AND WE'LL JUST TAKE A SCREENSHOT
BUT TEN THOUSAND MARKERS THAT'S JUST TOO MUCH EVEN JUST TEN THOUSAND DOM NODES
AND THE COLOR OF THE BUBBLE IS THE NUMBER OF FIREPLACES
WELL THE ANSWER IS UNBELIEVABLY SIMPLE
SO YOU CAN GO HERE AND YOU CAN USE THIS FOR TESTING GENERALLY

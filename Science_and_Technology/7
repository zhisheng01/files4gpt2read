REGARDLESS
DIGITALOCEAN MAKES INFRASTRUCTURE SIMPLE
SO THAT BEING ABLE TO PUT THOSE TWO TOGETHER OF HARDWARE NETWORK
THEY CUT THE PATHWAYS
SO HOW SHOULD A CAREFUL WRITER DISTINGUISH LEGITIMATE RULES OF USAGE FROM BOGUS ONES
AND IT WOULD SUPPORT SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY AS WELL
BECAUSE CLASSIC PROSE GIVES THE READER CREDIT FOR KNOWING THAT MANY CONCEPTS ARE HARD TO DEFINE AND MANY CONTROVERSIES HARD TO RESOLVE
WE'RE ALSO BUILDING EXOSKELETAL STRUCTURES USING THESE SAME PRINCIPLES
DESCRIBE HOW YOUR PERSPECTIVE SHIFTED AS YOU STARTED TO GAIN SOME SIGNIFICANT TRACTION WITH FREECODECAMP
THAT'S GOING TO BE GREAT
I BEGAN BY DEVELOPING SPECIALIZED LIMBS THAT ALLOWED ME TO RETURN TO THE VERTICAL WORLD OF ROCK AND ICE CLIMBING
OR THE EXTENSION I DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY IT WAS CALLED LET'S OUTPUT THIS MASTERPIECE TO THE DESKTOP
AND TESTING
I CAN TOTALLY SEE WHY EDUCATION IS THE WAY IT IS
THEY'RE CALLED LIKE HOME STAYS
VICTOROPS IMPROVES AND DELIVERS MORE VALUE TO YOU THROUGH MACHINE LEARNING
SO HERE I'VE DONE A SEARCH FOR CHINESE FOOD
WHEN WE LOOK AT TOPOLOGY ARCHITECTURES IT DOESN'T CARE WHETHER WE WOULD THINK OF THAT AS A REVERSE PROXY OR SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT THINK OF IT AS A FORWARD PROXY
YOU KNOW COLLECT ACCOLADES
I THOUGHT I'D INVENTED SKYNET BECAUSE WE BUILT A SYSTEM ALBEIT VERY SKELETAL SYSTEM
IT'S AN IMMERSIVE TWENTY FOUR HOUR DAY OF PRACTICAL DEVOPS STRATEGIES SHARED BY DEVELOPERS OPERATIONS PROFESSIONALS
G TWO I HAS THE TALENT THAT YOU NEED TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR GOALS
HUNDREDS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE PAPERS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THE PROBLEMS OF STABLE MATCHING AND THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT OFTEN TURNS OUT TO BE NP-COMPLETE
OH DEFINITELY
WELL
FOR EVERY SPECIES OR OTHER ENTITY OR PHENOMENON THERE EXIST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS FOR THE SOLUTION OF WHICH
AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT WE'RE USING HERE IS
WELL I SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO PEOPLE THROUGH MY COMPUTER
MANY OF THE LISTENERS ARE PROBABLY WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT APPLICATIONS THAT THEY'VE BUILT THEY JUST THINK OKAY I'VE GOT A WEBSITE AND I'VE GOT A DATABASE
AND THIS OTHER DEMO HERE DOES SORT OF THE SAME
THE QUESTION OF LATENCY ALWAYS COMES DOWN TO TESTING ENVIRONMENT
YOU'RE ABLE TO INTUIT YOUR WAY IN A VERY DIJKSTRA LIKE WAY THROUGH THE GRAPH TO KIND OF FIND THE SHORT PATH
I KNEW THAT BUT I THOUGHT I'D COUNT JUST FOR THEATRICS THAT'S THIRTEEN HOW MANY OF YOU FANCY DOING A NESTED DRAWING THIRTEEN TIMES ON YOUR RELATIONAL DATABASE
SHOWN HERE BY COLOR VARIATION IN THIS THREE D PRINTED MODEL
YEAH WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING AT FIFTEEN FRAMES PER SECOND THAT'S WHAT THE VIDEO FILES ARE IN THE APPLE VIDEO FILES ARE FIFTEEN
SO HOW DO YOU GUYS DECIDE WHAT TO PUT IN THE DICTIONARY
AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL IT FINALLY GETS TO THIRTY
IT JUST ADDS ZERO COPIES OF IT
SO YOU NEVER GET A RAISE WORST CASE SCENARIO
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO DEPLOY AND WRITE THE BEST POSSIBLE APPLICATION THEY CAN
SO FIRST
MY REQUEST HANDLER FUNCTION
BUT NOT THE MULTICLOUD PART
OUT OF THEIR THROATS
BETWEEN HUMAN LIMITATION
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS AFTER WE'VE CONSTRUCTED THE CHART OBJECT
IF WE LOOK AT THESE AND AGAIN COMPARING TO WE'RE GOING TO COMPARE CHROME AND FIREFOX
WHY DON'T YOU SPRAY THAT THING WITH A WEAK MIX OF BLEACH AND WATER STOP THAT MOLD RIGHT IN ITS TRACKS YOU GUYS
SOMETHING I'M PRETTY SURE YOU ACTUALLY DID A DIFFERENT PROJECT YOU DID FOR WORK WAS YOU WORKED ON SHARDING A PROMETHEUS SERVER RIGHT
THEY KNOW HOW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT WORKS THEY CAN HELP YOU FIND THE PERFECT ENGINEER FOR YOUR STACK
BUT THEN AS THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING BECAME MORE COMPLEX
ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE WE'RE LOCATED IN EUROPE
A LOT OF THE TECHNOLOGIES WERE SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU SEE ON THE PC
PIXELS THAT CAN BE STACKED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER SO YOU DON'T HAVE SCREEN DOOR EFFECTS
INSTEAD OF YOUR CUSTOMER SENDING THEIR DATA TO YOU
BECAUSE TO THEM WE'RE NOT EVEN HUMAN
HOW DOES THIS CONNECT SECURELY TO THE CLOUD HOW DOES THE CLOUD SCALE
WHILE THE EUGLENA IN HIS EXPERIMENTS SOUGHT OUT LIGHT AS EXPECTED
I MEAN I STARTED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY FOUR YEARS AGO
BECAUSE IT'S GIANT
YOU DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ACCESS TO THAT IF YOU'RE IN THE DOTNET WORLD BECAUSE THESE ARE ALL JAVA IMPLEMENTATIONS
I NEED TO EXCHANGE ESSENTIALLY WHAT IS CALLED THE CODE FOR THE ACCESS TOKEN
TO THEN RUNNING IT IN PRODUCTION IN A VERY SMOOTH FASHION
WE'VE DETECTED AROUND ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND HARMFUL SITES EVERY WEEK
WHICH I KNOW THE ANSWER TO
I AS A CUSTOMER PUBLISH THAT I'M LOOKING FOR A HOUSE PAINTER AND I HAVE TO WAIT WHILE THE DIFFERENT PROS BID ON THAT JOB
THE BROWSER WILL DO CERTAIN THINGS UPFRONT
THE GOAL IS TO HELP THE READER SEE OBJECTIVE REALITY AND THE STYLE IS CONVERSATION
THEN YOU CAN START THINKING ABOUT ISOLATING YOUR SPECIFIC INFRASTRUCTURE FROM YOUR BUSINESS LOGIC CODE
AND WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF POSTS ON FREECODECAMP DOT ORG SLASH FORUM
OKAY INTERESTING
IF YOU CAN MAKE IT TO BROOKLYN ON SEPTEMBER SEVENTEENTH
CONCRETE LANGUAGE WRITE WITH NOUNS AND VERBS
THE TWO ALREADY PERVADE AS MOST OF YOU HERE SEATED REALIZE EVERY DIMENSION OF HUMAN LIFE
AND THIS IS WHAT THE JSON LOOKUP LOOKS LIKE WE SAW THIS EARLIER IN THE DEMO CODE
AND MAPTIMIZE IS ACTUALLY A
OR AT LEAST HASH PREFIXES THE FIRST FOUR BYTES OF THE HASH
SO GOOD
PAGERDUTY HELPS YOUR COMPANY'S DIGITAL OPERATIONS ARE RUN MORE SMOOTHLY
EVERYONE KNOWS THE SOFTWARE HIRING PROCESS IS NOT PERFECT
DON'T PUT THAT IN THE VIDEO
THIS IS A SECURE WAY THE YOUR CUSTOMERS CAN USE YOUR APPLICATION WITHOUT EVER HAVING TO SEND DATA OUTSIDE OF THEIR CONTROL
WHAT TYPE OF DEVELOPER IS ZEIT FOR
LISTENERS OF THIS PODCAST WILL ALSO RECEIVE A FREE DATADOG T-SHIRT
WAIT SORRY
YOU DOWNLOAD AN APP AND IT MIGHT USE REACT NATIVE OR EXPO OR ANY TECHNOLOGY
HIGH BROW WAY TO SAY MAKE A TRIANGLE
THEY'RE LIKE IT'S A SPREADSHEET
I DELIVER PROGRAMMES PRODUCTS AND STRATEGIES TO OUR CORPORATE CLIENTS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF COMMUNICATIONS FUNCTIONS
INSTEAD OF DOING YOU KNOW PLUS EQUALS ON THE STRING IT CREATES AN ARRAY AND JOINS THE ARRAY AT THE BOTTOM ALSO MUCH FASTER
AND WE'RE ADDING A THOUSAND OH THAT'S GONNA BE REALLY BAD
SO CATEGORIES AND BASKETS AND WE STUCK THEM INTO A GRAPH
AND IN BETWEEN THE TALKS I HANG OUT AND EAT SOME MIXED NUTS CHAT WITH OTHER ENGINEERING LEADERSHIP ABOUT THE LATEST TALKS AND STUFF THAT THEY'RE SEEING
COVERAGE OR PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE COMING FROM BIG ORGANIZATIONS SO THERE IS A TRADEOFF
THAT MIGHT SOUND FAIRLY FAMILIAR TO SOME OF US THESE DAYS
IT'S A PATRONIZING THING THE RATIONAL PART IN MY BRAIN RIGHT
SPELLED IT RIGHT YEAH SHANE NEUVILLE
I'LL TAKE A FACTOR OF FOUR OUT
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY DEPLOY THEIR APPLICATION TO CLOUD FOUNDRY FOR THE FIRST TIME
LET ME SHOW YOU

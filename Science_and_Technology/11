IN A TYPICAL KUBERNETES ENVIRONMENT OR ANY CONTAINERIZED ENVIRONMENT
I CAN'T BELIEVE I SNUCK THAT PAST MARKETING
NOW THERE'S SITUATIONS WHERE YOUR USERS DO WANT THE INFORMATION ABOUT ALL THOSE POINTS
AND THE WAY
AND WE'VE DISCOVERED OPTIMALITY IS WHERE THE BODY IS STIFF THE SYNTHETIC SKIN SHOULD BE SOFT WHERE THE BODY IS SOFT THE SYNTHETIC SKIN IS STIFF AND THIS MIRRORING OCCURS ACROSS ALL TISSUE COMPLIANCES
THANKS TO VETTERY FOR BEING A SPONSOR OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY
KEEP YOUR EYES LIFTED AND YOUR HEAD TURNING
IF WE RAN THIS THROUGH LIKE A MACHINE LEARNING FRAMEWORK
IF I SORT THIS BY NAME YOU'LL SEE
WHICH IS BASICALLY DEBUGGER FOR DISTRIBUTED APPLICATION
BUT IT'S USED BY INTERNAL CLIENTS AS WELL
MORE RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE DONE
THAT'S REALLY NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE IN A MAPS API
AND I HAVE A FRIEND WHO I'VE KNOWN SINCE WE WERE TWELVE AND JUST IN THE LAST YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND SHE IS A CAPITAL-B BIRDER NOW
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO SAY RUN EXPERIMENTS
THIS SIMULATION REPRODUCES THE ROTATING MAGNET EXPERIMENT THAT YOU'VE SEEN A SECOND AGO
BUT I'M THINKING LIKE A IS BRIDGED BY THE EFFECTS TRACK TO THE B TRACK
IF YOU ENJOY WORKING WITH THEM YOU HIRE THEM FULL-TIME

YOU KNOW IT COULD JUST BE THAT EVERY HEAT MAP LOOKS LIKE THIS FOR BOSTON BECAUSE THE MOST AMOUNT OF RESTAURANTS FOR BOSTON IS THERE IN THE CITY
PSEUDO-INTELLECTUALS TRY TO BAMBOOZLE THEIR AUDIENCES WITH HIGHFALUTIN GOBBLEDYGOOK DISGUISING THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO SAY
OKAY I'VE GOT THIS BLOCK OF TIME AT THE END OF THE DAY DO I WANT TO WATCH AN EPISODE OF THE EXPANSE
SEND ME AN EMAIL TO JEFF AT SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM
OR GOOD PART OF WHAT I DO IS TALKING TO CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS
AS A TESTIMONY TO CURRENT TECHNOLOGY
YOU CAN TOGGLE FEATURES
BUILDING FREECODECAMP HAS REQUIRED EXPERTISE IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
YES
THEY FIGURE OUT OK WHAT ARE THE FOUR BEST COLORS THAT WILL CONTRAST WITH EACH OTHER NICELY
A LOT OF IT IS NOT SO MUCH A TEACHING ISSUE AS IT IS A COMMUNICATING ISSUE HOW DO YOU COMMUNICATE TO THE MIL LIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE USING THE FREECODECAMP CURR ICULUM THAT HEY THIS IS CHANGING
FOR NOW IN REACTIVEX YOU HAVE THESE THINGS LIKE COMPOSITEDISPOSABLE
SOME OF THEM ARE WILLING TO DO THE LAUNDRY
TITLE CROPPED
OBSERVABILITY AND SECURITY
OR THIS FROM AN EMAIL I RECEIVED IT IS IMPORTANT TO APPROACH THE SUBJECT FROM A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES
GOOGLE HAS BEEN RUNNING PRODUCTION WORKLOADS IN CONTAINERS FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS
AND THE AREA
SO LET'S START WITH IMPORTING OUR ASSETS INTO THE SCSI DISK
WHETHER YOU ARE TRANSLATING A WEBSITE A GAME A MOBILE APP OR EVEN VIDEO SUBTITLES
VISUALIZE KEY METRICS SET ALERTS TO IDENTIFY ANOMALIES AND COLLABORATE WITH YOUR TEAM TO TROUBLESHOOT AND FIX ISSUES FAST
SIMPLE AMOUNT OF CODE
I GUESS
WHERE THAT BREAKS DOWN IS THAT YOU SAY OKAY I'M GOING TO CREATE A MOBILE APPLICATION NOW
YOU DO IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
SO HERE'S ANOTHER DEMO FROM JOHN
WHEN YOU DECIDED TO BUILD FREECODECAMP YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING WITHOUT MUCH PRECEDENT
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THERE IS PROBABLY SOME VERY GOOD WAY TO AB TEST AND TO ARRIVE AT A TOTALLY OPTIMAL SOLUTION
AND THE MAJORITY OF STUFF
PREMIERE
ONE WAS GIVE THEM A HYPERVISOR THAT HAS A VERY VERY FAST START TIME
WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR US TO MAKE USE OF OUR DATA
LOOK TALL WEIRD SWEDISH GUY
WE'LL GIVE YOU DEPLOYMENT MODELS ON HOW TO INTERACT WITH THIS BUT YOU NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT
BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT
SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT A PELICAN THEY'RE ABOUT SIXTEEN POUNDS
OR THE ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU NEED RATHER THAN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE PROVIDE
WHATEVER IT IS
IT'S NOT EVEN JUST MANAGING THE SERVERS AS MACHINES
YOU CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE TOOLS THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW SUCH AS HELM AND MOVE APPLICATIONS TO ANY KUBERNETES DEPLOYMENT
THE HUMOUR IN WHICH
SECOND SEE WHAT YOUR PHONE PROVIDER CAN DO
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AND WE DO IT IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS
IS IT THE NATURE OF THE WARNING THAT'S THE PROBLEM OR IS IT THE WAY IT'S PRESENTED
SO PART TWO HOW CAN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DESIGN OF LEAVING LEAD TO BETTER WRITING ADVICE
LABOR OF LOVE
IT'S A COOL INSTRUCTIONAL TOOL
THERE ARE LOTS OF WAYS TO USE MONDAY
SO THEN THIS LET'S US NOW PUT TOGETHER NOW WE CAN PUT ALL OF THIS STUFF TOGETHER
THE TECHMEME RIDE HOME PODCAST IS DAILY IT'S ONLY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES LONG AND IT'S EVERY DAY
YEAH YEAH
YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE ROOM IN YOUR HIGHLIGHTS AND GAIN ROOM IN YOUR SHADOWS
HOW HAS YOUR TIME IN THE GAMING INDUSTRY PREPARED YOU FOR THE VIRTUAL REALITY WORLD
I LOVE YOU MOM BUT RELAX
NOW THAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT YOU CAN OUTPUT THIS SPECIAL LAMBDA FILES THAT WE CALL THEM AND THEN WHEN YOU GO TO THEM THEY EXECUTE CODE IN THE CLOUD NEAREST TO WHERE YOU'RE LOCATED
IN A TV SERIES CALLED THE THICK OF IT WHICH WAS A POLITICAL SATIRE
AND THAT'S WHERE WE USE ENVOY
OKAY WELL
THAT ANT WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT WERE IT NOT POSSESSED BY A FUNGUS ZOMBIE
SAY MERRIAM-WEBSTER'S AND LOOK UP SPLIT INFINITIVE IT WILL SAY
VICTOROPS IS A COLLABORATIVE INCIDENT RESPONSE TOOL
THE CAT IMAGES IN THIS CASE
COMPREHENSION AND ADHERENCE ARE THE CORNERSTONES OF VERY GOOD SECURITY UX
THERE ARE NO LOCK-IN EFFECTS
VENOMOUS
YEAH I THINK IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS TO WATCH AND IT'S JUST EXTREMELY ENJOYABLE TO SEE THE THINGS PEOPLE CREATE
UNTRADITIONAL ARCHITECTURE BUT IT'S ALWAYS USABLE IN THAT ASPECT

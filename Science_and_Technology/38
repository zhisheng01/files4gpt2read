THEY CAN GO THERE AND PEOPLE CHEER THEM ON
AND LOTS OF FRUSTRATION
BADLY NAMED EPISODE THEY LOST
AND BEING SURROUNDED BY TEN THOUSAND NESTING BIRDS
TELL ME ABOUT SOME OF THE TRENDS IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT THAT YOU'RE NOTICING THAT ARE SHAPING YOUR DECISIONS AROUND BUILDING ZEIT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTIONS AND THERE ARE A FEW VERY IMPORTANT ONES
THERE EXISTS A DISCIPLINE IN SCIENCE OR MEDICINE FOR WHICH THAT LEVEL IS ENOUGH TO ACHIEVE EXCELLENCE
GETTING THOSE FEELINGS OF LIKE OH MAN I GOT THIS WORKING

TODAY'S SHOW IS ABOUT MATCHING BUYERS AND SELLERS ON THUMBTACK A MARKET PLACE FOR LOCAL SERVICES
THE MORE INTEREST YOU HAVE IN ITS SUCCEEDING LONG-TERM
ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY WE'VE EXPLORED THE SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE AND BUSINESS MODELS OF THESE DIFFERENT MARKETPLACES
ESPECIALLY WHEN I WAS GR ILLING THESE DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATORS AND ASKING THEM A LOT OF QUESTIONS
G TWO I HAS THE TALENT THAT YOU NEED TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR GOALS
THE HILARIOUS THING OF THIS IS I KNOW THIS WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME BY A DEEP OR CONVOLUTED NEURAL NETWORK SO GRAPHS EVEN GAVE ME THIS HORRIFIC PICTURE THAT YOU SEE IN FRONT OF YOU

WE HAVE OUR CANCEL THAT'S WHEN THEY CLICK CANCEL
AND THERE'S ALSO THINGS LIKE DEVELOPER TOOLS AND SUCHLIKE THAT CAN ACTUALLY HELP YOU UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT WENT ON
THANKS TO TRIPLEBYTE FOR BEING A SPONSOR OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY WE APPRECIATE IT
WELL
BUT WE STILL OFFER A COUPLE OF OPTIONS
SO NOW THAT'S PROBABLY JUST GONNA BE LETTER BOXED LIKE THAT I WOULD IMAGINE
I'VE GONE THROUGH THE MAVEN HELLSCAPE OF JAVA BADNESS
I AM ASSUMING THAT THERE IS A CV PIPELINE THAT INCLUDES TESTING IN A VARIETY OF ENVIRONMENTS I'D PROBABLY TESTS ON WINDOWS AND APPLE

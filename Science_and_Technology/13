THE CLOUD MAKES IT CHEAP TO SAVE DATA
I'M ASSUMING THOSE ARE WHITE PELICANS AND YES
THAT'S PRETTY COOL
I ALSO HEAR ABOUT MANY NEWER HUNGRY SOFTWARE ENGINEERS WHO ARE LOOKING TO LEVEL UP QUICKLY AND PROVE THEMSELVES
SO THAT'S ME
JUST TO SEE A SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISON
NOW THERE IS TWO WAY TO DO THAT
BEING ABLE TO TEST THE CODE IN AS MANY DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS AS POSSIBLE IS REALLY IMPORTANT
FOLLOW ONE OR THE OTHER OF TWO PATHWAYS FIRST THROUGH EARLY DISCOVERIES
OKAY INSTEAD OF TAKING OUT THOSE TEN DOM NODES AND PUTTING TEN DOM NODES BACK IN
THIS MEANS THAT THEY WORK WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE FROM NONTRADITIONAL AND UNUSUAL BACKGROUNDS
SERVICE LEVEL AUTHENTICATION
SO THAT'S THE MAIN PLATFORM WHICH WE CALL NOW
I THINK YOU CAN'T DENY THE CROWDSOURCING ELEMENT OF THAT
NOT EVEN THIS CRICKET
G TWO I HAS THE TALENT THAT YOU NEED TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR GOALS
OR SUNSCREEN
SO IF YOU MULTIPLY THAT WHAT YOU GET IS FOUR POINT FOUR SECONDS
WITH KUBERNETES ENGINE ON GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM
SO I'M NOT ACTUALLY PROVIDING ANYTHING COMPLICATED FOR MY DATA TABLE
WHEN YOU HOLD DOWN THE CONTROL KEY YOU GET A LITTLE BLADE TOOL
OVER TWELVE THOUSAND BUSINESSES RELY ON PAGERDUTY TO IDENTIFY ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES IN REAL TIME AND BRING TOGETHER THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO FI X PROBLEMS FASTER AND PREVENT THOSE PROBLEMS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN
WIX HAS YOU COVERED SO YOU CAN SPEND MORE TIME FOCUSING ON YOURSELF AND YOUR CLIENTS
SO THAT'S THE DRAWING RIGHT THERE
SO THERE ARE THESE IDEAS OF SEEING YOUR INPUT
SO WHAT I DID IS I SAID AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE IT'S COMING FROM IS
I'M AN MIT PROFESSOR
SEE ISSUES AS IF THEY HAPPENED IN YOUR OWN BROWSER WITH A FULL VIDEO REPLAY AND GET THOSE ISSUES FIXED FAST TO MAINTAIN THE HEALTH OF YOUR APPLICATION AND KEEP CUSTOMERS HAPPY
FIRST OFF
MEANWHILE THANK YOU SO MUCH TO EVERYONE WHO'S RATING AND REVIEWING AND SUBSCRIBING
A BEAUTIFUL STORY
GO TO SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM SLASH DATADOG TO GET THAT FREE T-SHIRT AND TRY OUT DATADOG'S MONITORING SOLUTIONS TODAY
AND THE TINY MONSTER IN YOUR GARAGE STARTS OUT WITH ONLY EIGHT
FIFTEEN SECONDS AUTO-ADVANCE
INFECTED SOFTWARE
WHEN YOU'RE OUT TO DINNER AND YOUR PHONE BUZZES BECAUSE YOUR ENTIRE APPLICATION IS DOWN
BUT THERE ARE SOME DOWNSIDES ONE DOWNSIDE IS WE LEARN ABOUT YOUR URLS
WHICH TYPES DID THEY BID ON THE MOST OFTEN
HEURISTICS FOR THINGS LIKE OKAY WELL IF I'M TAKING OUT NINETY PERCENT OF THE THINGS ON THE MAP
WHAT THAT MEANS IS YOU DEPLOY A SERVER
BUT YOU WERE VERY CONFIDENT THAT IT WOULD WORK
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS APPROACH IS THAT THEY'RE VERY LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC
MOST PEOPLE ARE HARD-WORKING AND INTELLIGENT
NO SERVICE CAN GET OR NO TRAFFIC CAN GET TO THAT SERVICE
RIGHT SO WE HAVE A CUSTOMER COMING IN
AND THEN THE NUMBER OF GUESTS COMING FROM THAT AREA
LOTS AND LOTS OF PAGES EVERY DAY
SO WHEN YOU MAKE A NOW DEPLOYMENT WE AUTOMATICALLY CONFIGURE A CDN LAYER IN FRONT OF YOUR DEPLOYMENT
WE WANT TO MAKE THE INTERNET A SAFER PLACE FOR EVERYBODY
SO THE IDEA BEHIND THIS TO KIND OF BREAK DOWN THE STRUCTURES
RIGHT THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO LOVE PROGRAMMING AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR DECADES
WORKERS AND COMPANIES ON THE PLATFORM ARE VETTED AND THIS VETTING PROCESS KEEPS THE WHOLE MARKET HIGH-QUALITY
IT'S KIND OF THE SAME WAY A WORM GETS AROUND
I THINK IT WAS AT A BERKELEY TACO PLACE
THIS IS INTERESTING IT SAYS WE WILL NOT RENT OR SELL YOUR INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES OUTSIDE INSTAGRAM BUT THEN IT LISTS A BUNCH OF EXCEPTIONS INCLUDING GIVING THIS INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING PARTNERS WHICH IS NOT GOOD AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT YOU'RE MOST INTERESTED IN
AND BY DOING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO EVOLVE OUR FRONTEND INDEPENDENTLY OR EVEN GO TO MORE PLATFORMS
THANKS TO EXAPTIVE FOR BEING A NEW SPONSOR OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY
IN MY OWN FLUID SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS WHEN I TRIED TO SOLVE THE PRESSURE FIELD USING ONE TO FOUR ITERATIONS GAVE ME A RESULT THAT'S NOT ONLY INACCURATE
IT WAS MEANT AS A LOWER LEVEL INFRASTRUCTURE PIECE TO BUILD PLATFORMS AS A SERVICE ON TOP OF
TRUE STORY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES LITERALLY SAID THAT TO ME THIS MORNING
OKAY THIS IS A HOT TOPIC AND ANGELA MAYFIELD KATA ZARANDY AMBER KING SKYLAR L PRIMM MELISSA HANNON AND JULIANA ALL WANTED TO KNOW IS IT A SYMBOL OF SACRIFICE OR IS IT JUST MEDIEVAL FLIMFLAM
THAT'S MY
IF WE TELL THE STORY CORRECTLY
I MEAN
THEY LOOK LIKE MUMMY BABIES
I TOOK THE QUIZ AND IT COVERED A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS GENERAL PROGRAMMING ABILITY
YOU STILL HAVE THE SAME TRAFFIC REQUIREMENTS WITHIN THAT CLUSTER THAT YOU WOULD HAVE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN YOU WERE BUILDING OUT APPLICATION SERVICES WITHIN A DATA CENTER
TURNS OUT THAT JANE AUSTIN USED SINGULAR THEY EIGHTY SEVEN TIMES IN HER NOVELS
I MEAN LIKE BARELY LIVABLE RIGHT
CASPER OFFERS FREE DELIVERY AND FREE RETURNS WITH A ONE HUNDRED NIGHT HOME TRIAL
SO LET'S TAKE IS OUR CHILDREN LEARNING WHICH NOT ONLY GEORGE W BUSH BUT THE MICROSOFT WORD GRAMMAR CHECKER
THERE ARE FREE MAIN TOOLS THAT YOU CAN USE TO PROTECT YOUR USERS
ARE YOU ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO RE-ARCHITECT THEIR APPLICATION FOR ZEIT OR ARE YOU GOING AFTER NEW GREENFIELD APPLICATIONS AND SAYING HEY TRY OUT ARCHITECTING YOUR APP THIS WAY AND IT'S GOING TO WORK WELL
YOU CAN SEE THE PARAMECIUM ACTUALLY TURN AROUND
WOULD YOU ACCEPT
OR EVEN FROM THOSE THAT ARE MORE FUTURE-ORIENTED
IGNORE
AND EVEN THAT THE DISTANCE YOU CAN SEE MAINE AND WASHINGTON KIND OF COMING TOGETHER
RATHER THAN DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOWS
A BLACKOUT NOT A BROWNOUT
AND TRANSLATE IT TO A FLAT SURFACE
BUT BASICALLY
FOR EXAMPLE
I THINK THAT'S VERY NICE
PORT SCANNER WAS ONE OF THEM THEN I THINK AT SOME POINT I JUST WANT TO BUILD A ROUTER JUST TO SEE HOW THAT WORKS
THESE ARE ENGINEERS WHO KNOW ABOUT THE REACT ECOSYSTEM ABOUT THE MOBILE ECOSYSTEM ABOUT GRAPHQL REACT NATIVE
IF YOU MODEL YOUR DAGS IN AIRFLOW
HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHICH ONES TO ACTUALLY SPEND YOUR TIME ANALYZING
LIKE A BIGGER STATE SCHOOL
IN REALMS OF GENETICS REGENERATIVE MEDICINE AND SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
MY DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS WOULD BE BROKEN UP INTO DIFFERENT FILES
THAT ALLOWS YOU A LAYER OF INDIRECTION FROM WHICH TO ISOLATE YOUR BUSINESS LOGIC FROM YOUR SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT
IT'S STILL DOING THE SAME THING FOR US
THAT'S THE SEMANTICS OF IT
AND NEAT IS BASED ON THESE PRINCIPLES HERE
REMEMBER YOUR DECISION AS A USER FOR ABOUT A WEEK
WITH PAGERDUTY TEAMS SPEND LESS TIME REACTING TO INCIDENTS AND MORE TIME BUILDING SOFTWARE
WE'VE GOT I SQUARE ROOT OF MINUS ONE
MICROSECONDS
NOW

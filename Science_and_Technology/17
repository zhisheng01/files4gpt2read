WHICH WOULD BE EXTREMELY LOW FRICTION
SO IT WORKS REALLY WELL
IT'S VERY VERY QUICKLY EVOLVING AS WE KNOW
BUT ACTUALLY APART FROM THE GIGGLES THIS IS A HUGE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE IF YOU SPOT SOMEONE THAT PARTIALLY MATCHES THIS PATTERN
VETTERY IS CHANGING THE WAY PEOPLE GET HIRED AND THE WAY THAT PEOPLE HIRE
THERE'S A PRETTY KEY IMPLICATION TO JENNINGS' OBSERVATIONS HERE THE STENTORS HE OBSERVED DIDN'T JUST REACT TO STIMULUS
SO
JAVASCRIPT OBJECT NOTATION LANGUAGE
THE USERS UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON
THAT HAS A WAY OF TRICKLING UPWARD TO COMPANIES AND A LOT OF THE STORIES THAT WE READ ABOUT THAT ARE LIKE WHAT IS THIS COMPANY DOING
THE OTHER DATA IS DATA THAT IS INGESTED FROM THE OUTSIDE EITHER FROM OUTSIDE ENTITIES OR EVEN SENSORS
AND THE THIRD THING TO NOTICE IS THAT IT ACTUALLY IS CREATING WE'RE IN THIS IN OUR VERSION WE ONLY CREATE ONE DOM NODE PER MARKER
TRY TO FEEL HER PAIN WALK A MILE IN HER MOCCASINS AND SO ON
TODAY'S EPISODE IS ABOUT ZEIT

THERE WERE TYPICALLY ONE OR TWO TEAMS THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THE TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONALITY
WELL I SAID EARLIER THAT I'M REALLY BAD ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE TO DONATE TO FREECODECAM

OR CHECK OUT OUR APPS IN THE IOS OR ANDROID APP STORE
BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL OVERLY OPINIONATED
TELL ME ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THIS DEPLOYMENT WOULD LOOK LIKE IN THE SERVERFULL WORLD VERSUS IN THE ZEIT SERVERLESS WORLD
ORIGINAL RESEARCH CAN BE STATED AS FOLLOWS
HAVING IT IN THE BEGINNING
THE BIG BANG THEORY WAS BORN
SO HE ASKED THE GUY NEXT TO HIM HE SAYS WHAT'S HAPPENING
SO
OH MY GOSH SO SIXTEEN POUNDS
WHICH IS WHERE PIVOTAL GETS ITS NAME FROM
IT'S JUST REALLY REALLY TRANSFORMATIONAL
THIS LITTLE GUY HAS TRIED A FEW LOCATIONS BUT HERE
THAT'S THE SIDECAR
BUT KUBERNETES CREATE A STANDARDIZED SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE COULD INSTALL HELM CHARTS WHICH DESCRIBE A DISTRIBUTED APPLICATION
THE DAGS ARE OFTEN HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF NODES
AND THERE'S NO ESCAPE
ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO ADD NICK
SO AT ONE
AN AUTO-DETECTION ENGINE THAT ALERTS YOU TO PERFORMANCE ANOMALIES ACROSS YOUR APPLICATIONS
DIFFERENT SPECIMENS OF THE SAME SPECIES SEEMED TO HAVE THEIR OWN RANKED PREFERENCES
YOU'RE EMPOWERED TO CONTINUOUSLY AND INTELLIGENTLY RO LLOUT CHANGES AS SOON AS THEY ARE CODE COMPLETE ON ANY PLATFORM
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO LIKE KICK OFF A WEB REQUEST EVERY TIME SO THAT'S EFFECTIVELY WHAT THIS IS DEMONSTRATING
A VIRTUAL SERVICE DEFINES WHERE MY TRAFFIC IS ROUTED WITHIN THE MESH
SO IT'S ONE THING TO SAY WELL
YOU SEE IN THE REFERENCE FOOTAGE HERE THAT THIS ALSO MEANS IF THERE IS NO MAGNETIC FIELD WE HAVE A REGULAR FLUID SIMULATION
BUT ON THE BACKEND WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT THREE OF THE FUNCTION WILL BE CALLED IN THE MONOLITHIC APPLICATION ONE OF THEM WILL BE CALLED ON THE SERVERLESS FUNCTION
AGAIN
HAVE A NODE JS FUNCTION
YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST ONE
THE START STOP OR RECORD BUTTON IS LOCATED ON THE FRONT-RIGHT OF THE CAMERA BODY AS WELL AS THE GRIP UNIT
AND SO THOSE ARE A COUPLE STRATEGIES WE'VE USED
MAN NOW TURN AROUND AND DO THE SAME THING WALKING UP
DATABASES HAVE TABLES RIGHT SQUARE THINGS YOU PUT DATA IN THEM OKAY BYE BYE
THIS IS KIND OF THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG
BECAUSE WHEN WE ACHIEVE A SYMMETRY BETWEEN THE OUTPUT AND ITS UNDERLYING BACKEND ORGANIZATION
BE A PRODUCT WHERE YOUR DEVELOPERS YOUR BUILDERS HAVE BEEN USING DAGSTER AS A PRODUCTIVITY TOOL TO MAKE THEMSELVES MORE PRODUCTIVE AND EFFICIENT

IF LIKE ME YOU'RE A COMPLETE BLUFFER AT AI
AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU AS A CHILD THEY TERRIFIED ME
AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN EASY FOR US TO BE PRODUCTIVE WITH HEROKU
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE IN
DESCRIBE THE LOAD BALANCER MARKET WHEN YOU STARTED AT THE COMPANY IT WAS ALL HARDWARE I MEAN IT WAS BIG BIG IRON BIG VOLUME
YOU'RE AT GOOGLE PERIL TO WAIT AND GO MEET CUSTOMERS IN A CERTAIN REGION THAT THEY ARE NOT IN YET
THERE WE GO
IT IS LIGHT YES
ALSO A VERY VERY COOL SERVICE YOU CAN ESSENTIALLY PUBLISH A MESSAGE
SO IN ITIALLY WHAT I BUILT OVER THE COURSE OF THAT WEEKEND WAS A CURR ICULUM WHERE YOU COULD PROGRESS THROUGH YOU COULD SIGN IN AND YOU COULD MARK THINGS DONE
IF YOU BUILT YOUR OWN JAVASCRIPT GAME FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULD SUBMIT THAT
THE STENTOR TRIED TO CONTRACT AWAY FROM THE STIMULUS
SHE LOST HER DAD
YEAH THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AS WELL
BECAUSE WE CAN GO IN AND NOT START FROM SCRATCH
WHEREAS NO CHILD HAS AN INSTINCTIVE TENDENCY TO BAKE BREW OR WRITE
I HAVE USED HERROKU PERSONALLY MORE THAN ANY OTHER CLOUD PROVIDER

NOW I MADE SURE TO SHAVE MY LEGS LAST NIGHT BECAUSE I KNEW I'D BE SHOWING THEM OFF
THE FACT THAT I GET TO BE SO CLOSE TO THESE BIRDS IS WILD
ONE IS A COMPANY
WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO TROUBLESHOOT THE DATABASE
SO AS I SAY
THE FIRST ONE IS THE SAFE BROWSING BEFORE LOOK UP API DOCUMENTATION
IT TURNS OUT WE WORK WITH A BUNCH OF PSYCHOLOGISTS
AND THAT'S WHERE THE MOST NUMBER OF LOCAL SEARCH RESULTS ARE
STILL A BIT THOUGH
SPIN DOWN A VM GIVE ME A DISK RESIZE A DISK OR THROW AWAY A DISK
I THINK THE PEDAGOGY THAT WE BAKED INTO IT IS VERY AS TUTE AND IT WORKS
THANK YOU TO TRIPLEBYTE
PERFECT MARKETPLACE MATCHING IS AN UNSOLVED PROBLEMS
WE THINK THIS IS PART OF THEIR INSPECTION PROCESS

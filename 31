EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS HAVE SACRIFICED THEIR TIME
COMMENT FROM JACQUELINE VORONA
COMMENT FROM CHRISTOPER DAVIDSON
RELAX TO BE
HOW MANY LIVES WILL BE LOST
AND YOU CAN RECONSTRUCT THE HISTORY OF THAT PIECE OF DNA WITH THE HELP OF THESE DIFFERENCES YOU OBSERVE
TAKES ADVANTAGE OF IN A WAY THAT'S NOT IN PEOPLE'S BEST INTEREST

SCHOOL NEEDS TO REOPEN IN AUGUST FOR IN PERSON LEARNING

A HARVARD GRAD WHO WOULD KIND OF RATHER BE ELSEWHERE
PUBLIC HEALTH MUST ALSO CONTEND WITH BIG FOOD
WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT THAT SYSTEM FOR THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY RETIRE
PART ONE REVOLUTION
SO WHAT'S SOMETHING YOU LIKE THAT'S UNPOPULAR
YOU COULD TRY TO TRAIN PEOPLE ON A SMALL SET OF FACES THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THEM
AND I HOPE THEY'RE LEARNING THAT BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE
RESOURCES THAT CAN SAVE LIVES
LETTING THAT QUESTION WHY CAN'T WE LIVE THIS WAY ALL THE TIME WHEN WE SHOW THE BEST OF OURSELVES
FOR IT TO
IS TO REALLY ANALYZE LIKE WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT LOVE IN MY ORDINARY LIFE AND IN FACT I KNOW A LOT
I MEAN
AND SO LIKE
I CAN GET AGITATED DEPENDING ON THE TOPIC AT HAND AND WHO IN THE MEETING IS TALKING AND HOW THEY'RE ADDRESSING THE TOPIC
YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR SEPARATION FROM YOUR FATHER
YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT THE SAVVY PSYCHOLOGIST PODCAST
AND VERY SOON A WARM
THIS WILL BE A RIGGED ELECTION
AGAIN CLAIRE WAS A DELIGHT
BUT MOST PEOPLE WILL SAY
WHICH WHEN WELL-PRACTICED LETS SOMEONE WRITE VERY QUICKLY INDEED
SHE'D BEEN TOO EMBARRASSED AND TOO ASHAMED TO EVEN CALL FOR EXAMPLE THE CARERS COUNSELLING LINE
AT SCHOOL HE BANDED TOGETHER WITH OTHER STUDENTS AND PUSHED THE ADMINISTRATION TO UPDATE ITS SUICIDE PREVENTION PROGRAM
WE'RE ALSO TAKING A LOOK AT THE LOCAL EFFORTS BY DOCTORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GET AHEAD OF THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC AND WE'RE LOOKING AT LOCAL AND NATIONAL RESOURCES
DON'T SEEK YOUR EX OUT DON'T AVOID THEM EITHER
RELIEF CHECKS PRESCRIPTIONS PACKAGES CARDS LETTERS THE WAY WE GET OUR BILLS I MEAN
IS IT
I'M SAM SANDERS WITH TWO ALL-STARS HOST OF ALL THINGS CONSIDERED ARI SHAPIRO
THE WAY IT PLAYED OUT IN THE MID FIFTY S WAS THAT HE DID THESE EXPERIMENTS AND SOMEBODY IN A COLORADO NEWSPAPER PICKED UP THE STORY AND THEN IT HIT THE HEADLINES NATIONALLY AND BECAME A NATIONAL SENSATION VERY QUICKLY
CONGRATULATIONS
LIKE WE'RE IN SOME KIND OF GOLDEN AGE OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES
I ENDED UP IN HOSPITAL AND I GOT THAT MISDIAGNOSIS OF BORDERLINE
WHO NORMALLY WOULD BE HERE WITH THE CHILDREN
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WERE LINED UP ALONG THE ROAD JUST SO TOUCHED THAT HE'D COME TO SEEK THEM OUT
MORE THAN ONE AND LESS THAN FOURTEEN UNITS A WEEK ON AVERAGE TWO DRINKS A DAY
FOR EXAMPLE HERE IN D C THEY'RE GOING TO BE AT THE SMITHSONIAN ARTS AND INDUSTRIES BUILDING COOL BUILDING ON THE EVENING OF OCTOBER TWENTY SECONDS AGO TO SLATE DOT COM SLASH LIVE TO GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT
IT HAS AN INTERNAL LOGIC
WELL HERE'S THE PROBLEM TRYMAINE
HOWEVER
AND THAT BOARD RECENTLY APPOINTED A NEW POSTMASTER GENERAL LOUIS DEJOY
I INTERVIEWED HER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA AS PART OF THIS SEASON'S ARTS AND LECTURE SERIES
THAT I WAS LEFT WITH NOTHING
YOU KNOW COULD I RECONNECT WITH MY IRANIAN CULTURE AND THAT WOULD HELP STEM SOME INTERGENERATIONAL TRAUMA OR STOP ME FROM PASSING IT DOWN TO MY KIDS RIGHT AND WHAT IF YOU CAN'T PHYSICALLY MOVE BACK WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE PRACTICING THE CULTURE THAT YOU'RE CUT OFF FROM
I WENT FROM THERE
THEIR LISTENER CHATTERS THIS WEEK
YOU'RE DISSEMINATING CULTURE IS WHAT'S GOING ON IT'S NOT ONLY HUNTING
YEAH
THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT I DO NOT HAVE AS PRESIDENT THE LEGAL RIGHT TO DO SO I DO BUT I HAVE SO FAR CHOSEN NOT TO EXCLAMATION POINT SO
THE COMPONENTS THAT WE USE ARE ANIMATED CHARACTERS
APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY PERCENT OR MORE OF PEOPLE WITH EITHER DIABETES OR DEPRESSION OR HEART DISEASE ACTUALLY HAVE THREE OR MORE CHRONIC ILLNESSES NOT JUST ONE MOST OF THE INTERVENTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO TRY TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE FOR CHRONIC MEDICAL ILLNESSES HAVE FOCUSSED ON ONE CONDITION ALONE
THEN INSTANTLY YOU THINK TOMORROW
THERE ARE FIVE MENTAL HEALTH WORKERS ON THE ISLAND AND MARY MALONEY A REGISTERED MENTAL HEALTH NURSE IS A NEWCOMER TO TIWI
EVERYONE AT NEWSDAY COULD DO ONE CHAPTER
THE BEHAVIOR OF THIS ADMINISTRATION AND ITS CONTINUED WILLINGNESS TO IGNORE RUSSIA TO BACK DOWN FROM RUSSIA TO STEP BACK WHEN THEY TELL US TO STEP BACK HAS PLACED A TARGET ON THE BACK OF ALL OUR GUYS
SO IF THAT'S WHAT WE WANT EVERYONE TO ADHERE TO
THOSE WERE TWO BIG BIG PROBLEMS BEFORE THIS
WHICH APPARENTLY ALL THE MUSIC I LIKE IS DERIVED FROM AND I DON'T KNOW WHY I'D NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE BUT I LOVE THEIR MUSIC I'M SURE YOU ALL KNOW IT ALREADY WHATEVER IT SUITS
WHAT SORTS OF THINGS DO YOU THINK THAT YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT NOW WITH YOURSELF TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T GET SICK AGAIN
I WANT US EACH TO DESCRIBE THIS WEEK OF NEWS IN ONLY THREE WORDS YOU ALL HAVE PREPARED
ON THE ACTUAL HALLOWEEN I WILL BE HOSTING ALL THINGS CONSIDERED WEAR A COSTUME WHILE YOU HOST
IN THE END HE DID GET WHAT HE NEEDED FROM THAT AND MAYBE GOING HOME HE MIGHT NOT HAVE COMPLICATED NO KIDDING
YEAH YOU KNOW I THINK OF MYSELF AS A AS A GOOD HUMAN BEING
LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED TO PAUL RYAN WHO PUTS FORTH A PLAN THAT YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE
EVEN WHEN IT'S PAINFUL TO HEAR AND I WOULD ADD THAT ALL OF THIS IS A NUMBERS GAME TO SOME DEGREE IN THE SAME WAY THAT IF YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED YOU NEED TO GO OUT ON A LOT OF DATES
HOW CHOOSE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER IS DEREK JOHN MERRITT JACOB IS OUR ENGINEER
IS IT A BETTER STRATEGY TO LASH OUT AND MAYBE GET IT OFF YOUR CHEST OR TO PUT IN TIME IF YOU THINK THAT PERSON IS REACHABLE AND TO MAYBE TRY TO EMPLOY SOME OF THESE STRATEGIES WE'VE TALKED ABOUT EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WORK EVEN IF THEY'RE A WASTE OF TIME
AND THEN YOU CUT BETWEEN THEM REACTING THE KEY OF COURSE IS FINDING ORDINARY PEOPLE WHO THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE SEASON THEY BECOME TELEVISION STARS THEMSELVES NONETHELESS REMAIN ORDINARY SEEMING THAT'S HARDER PROBABLY THAN IT SEEMS ANYWAY FROM THIS NOW ANACHRONISTIC SOMEWHAT ANACHRONISTIC HABIT OF A FAMILY GATHERING AROUND THE TV AND WATCHING A SHOW AT THE SAME TIME
OF COURSE THE BIGGEST ONE IS INTANGIBLE AND THAT'S MY LIFE BECAUSE I TOOK IT BACK
DO YOU HAVE AN INDIGENOUS BACKGROUND YOURSELF
IF SHE'S OKAY YEAH I NEED THE KNIFE AS LOUDLY AS YOU CAN
TRYING TO THINK WHAT ARE SOME EXPLANATIONS LIKE I JUST DON'T TRUST YOU OR I SAY I QUESTION YOUR MOTIVES OR YOU'RE SAYING THIS FOR A REASON
IN THIS CASE IT ABSOLUTELY CAN
RISE ABOVE
UNAWARE THAT IT WAS A SPOOF IT WOULD BE NICE IF THIS BOOK COULD BE JUDGED BY ITS COVER WHICH IS EASILY THE BEST PART IN THE CATEGORY OF EROTIC FANTASY
WHEN WAGES DON'T GROW
AND HE SAID THE FOLLOWING IT STARTS OFF WITH A QUOTE
BUT WHAT ABOUT A MORE PERSONAL APPROACH FOR THE RECALCITRANT IGNORAMUS IN YOUR OWN LIFE STEP ONE DON'T CALL THEM THAT STEP TO PRACTICE PERSUASION
AND HE SAID ONCE HE LEFT NPR
SO WHAT IF YOU ACTUALLY TRIED TO WRITE A PREPOSTEROUSLY BAD EROTIC NOVEL
THERE WAS A MEMBER OF THE TENTH SPECIAL FORCES GROUP
IS THAT FOR ALL OF THESE VARIOUS TYPES
NEEDLESS TO SAY THE DEAL WAS NOT HONOURED
THAT'S OKAY
ALL RIGHT WELL
WAS ASSASSINATED
EVEN AFTER THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL WAS OVER
I MEAN LIKE I LIKE IN MY PREVIOUS LIFE AS A NEWS PRODUCER I'VE BOOKED SENATORS I'VE BOOKED PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ON THE SPORKFUL WE'VE BOOKED GUY FIORI AND ALTON BROWN AND PADMA LAKSHMI AND AND BIG COMEDIANS
WHERE'S THE EMPTINESS IN THIS
LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU KNOW LOOK AT THE SERVICE THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING
HUMAN RIGHTS BUT WE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT SOCIAL ISSUES AND PROBLEMS
ON AVERAGE FIVE SERVINGS OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES A DAY
JUST HOURS AFTER MAKING THOSE REMARKS FROM THE OVAL OFFICE AT THE END OF LAST MONTH
BECAUSE THEY DISCUSS THE MOST ESSENTIAL ISSUES WITH SUCH HONESTY AND VULNERABILITY
WELL I FELT QUITE IMMEDIATELY PASSIONATE ABOUT THE TOPIC OF SCHIZOPHRENIA BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A MULTIFACTORIAL CONDITION IN CAUSE AND OUTCOME
THEN WE HAVE MEDICATION ERRORS YOU'LL GO TO YOUR GP AND YOUR GP WILL SET THAT UP WITH YOU
AND THE TIMESCALE ON WHICH ALL THIS TRANSFORMATION WILL HAPPEN IS FAR FROM PREDICTABLE
SO EVEN IF INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THEM IT MAY NOT BE WELL UNDERSTOOD
AND JUST HOW WE CONFRONT THIS AVOIDABLE TRAGEDY IS NOW IN PLAY
AND I THINK THAT THAT WAS ALSO
THAT INCLUDES SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS BUT THERE IS SOME QUESTION OVER WHO CAN ADMINISTER NARCAN

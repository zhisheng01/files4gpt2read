IT'S A NEW CULTURE YOU KNOW CULTURAL TRADITIONS ARE LIVING THINGS
REVELATIONS ABOUT TRUMP
SO IT CERTAINLY BEARS WATCHING

THEY WILL NOT THROW THEMSELVES IN FRONT OF MICROPHONES YEAH
YOU KNOW A THIRTY THREE CD SET WELL THAT'S WHAT IT TOOK
AS A LOCAL POLITICIAN WITH FEW RESOURCES

A LOT OF PAUL KRASSNER'S STORIES OR HE CALLED THEM HOAXES ACTUALLY ENDED UP FUELING CONSPIRACY THEORIES DURING THIS ERA BECAUSE

AMERICA
FOR TWO YEARS RORY ROBERTSON HAS BEEN A THORN IN THE SIDE OF ADMINISTRATORS AT SYDNEY UNIVERSITY

I JUST CARE ABOUT
OKAY
THAT'S NOT NOTHING
AND HE TOOK US INTO THE WOODS NOT PHYSICALLY BUT IT TOOK THE FBI AGENTS INTO THE WOODS PHYSICALLY AND THEY GOT OUT A BACKHOE AND THEY DUG UP THIS BODY THAT HAD BEEN MISSING FOR SEVEN YEARS
WHAT THE POSTAL SERVICE DOES IS THEY ASSIGN PEOPLE TO THE ELECTION COMMISSION
AND I THINK THAT ROBERTS IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AND THAT HE WANTS THE COURT TO THREAD A NEEDLE IT IS NOT AT ALL CLEAR THAT THE OTHER FOUR CONSERVATIVES SHARE THAT DEEP COMMITMENT THEY HAVE A LOT OF THINGS THEY WANT TO DO AND SOME OF THEM SEEM LIKE THEY'RE IN A BIG RUSH

BUT TO GET ANSWER
WE DON'T HAVE DEBT BECAUSE OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE BUT WHAT ABOUT THE FUTURE

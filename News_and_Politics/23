I'M NOT AS DEEPLY AFFECTED AS SHE WAS OF COURSE
AS IT'S COME DOWN TO US FROM THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
A WAY OF LIFE SAM UNDERSTANDS BECAUSE IT'S A PART OF HIM YOU'RE WITH YOUR FAMILY YOU'RE SITTING IN A SEAL BLIND YOU'RE TALKING TO YOUR UNCLES YOU'RE TELLING STORIES
BUT ONE WAY AROUND IT
I MEAN NOW THE COLONISTS HAD EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HIS CONSPIRACY THEORY WAS ENTIRELY TRUE
ADVERTISING PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS SHOWROOMS
ANCHOR WITH MSNBC AND THE SENIOR BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT FOR NBC NEWS
I HAVE A FEW
BUT I FORGOT MY SAXOPHONE SO I SAID DAD
AND THEN THERE WERE THE MORE IMAGINATIVE ONES PLEASE TELL ME THEY INVOLVE ALIENS
FOR ME THE WAY QUESTIONS WERE SUPPRESSED
LIZZIE TIPILOURA IS ONE OF THE ABORIGINAL MENTAL HEALTH WORKERS IN THE AIM HIGH PROJECT WITH TRISH NAGEL
THERE'S ALSO A NEW DAVID PUMPKINS HALLOWEEN SPECIAL ON NBC THIS WEEK AND IT'S ANIMATED
FIFTY SIX PERCENT WERE AGAINST THAT IS UP THIRTY TWO PERCENT
WHILE CAPEK'S PLAY SUGGESTED AN UNEASY CO-EXISTENCE
NOT FROM HARD SCIENCE
TAKE THE MEMORY WARS OF THE EIGHTY S AND NINETY S
I MEAN I'M OPENING MYSELF UP
HOW IS THIS GOING TO WORK
LIKE A TEACHER WOULD RIGHT
AVERA WILL USE THE MILLION DOLLAR GRANT TO MAKE SURE DOCTORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS SOUTH DAKOTA KNOW HOW TO RESPOND TO PATIENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH OPIOIDS BECAUSE IT'S DIFFERENT THAN OTHER ADDICTIONS
EVEN IN THE FACE OF PUBLIC DISASTER YOU'RE HIGHLIGHTING THESE POINTS OF HOPE
THE IMAGERY WAS ABSURD
EVEN IF WE RAISED THE PRICE THAT'S NOT GONNA SOLVE IT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THEY COULD CUT
LISTEN ANY BUSINESS THAT HAS STAYED OPEN DURING THIS
AND THEN THE OTHER FACTOR
WE NEED TO HAVE A DIFFERENT IMMIGRATION POLICY
LIZZIE TIPILOURA IS ONE OF THE ABORIGINAL MENTAL HEALTH WORKERS ON BATHURST ISLAND WHO'S BEEN WORKING WITH DR TRISH NAGEL IN AN INNOVATIVE PROGRAM CALLED AIM HIGH
HAS BEEN RELENTLESS IN HIS ATTACKS AGAINST HER
YEAH
YES I FILED MY APPEAL OCTOBER SIX AND STILL HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING WELL I WILL SAY I DID REACH OUT TO FEMA IN ADVANCE OF OUR CALL BECAUSE I WANTED TO JUST SEE WHAT THEY'RE SAYING ABOUT ALL OF THIS
WELL CONTESTANTS I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT IN THIS ROUND OF WHAT IN THE WORD NONE OF YOU WERE CORRECT
WE KNOW SOME OF THE GENES THAT EXPLAIN PANCREATIC CANCER
I HOPE THAT'S BEEN CANCELED BUT YEAH
KIAN WAS NEVER ONE OF THEM
I THINK THAT'S A MEASURE OF MY GUILT BY THE WAY OBVIOUSLY I DO FEEL GUILTY BECAUSE OTHERWISE I WOULD OWN IT
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER TOO THEY WERE MONTHS AWAY FROM SENIORS NOT GETTING THEIR BENEFIT CHECKS
FMRI BRAIN SCANNING IS ALSO USED
PROFESSOR AMANDA LEE HAS PUBLICLY CRITICISED THE AUSTRALIAN PARADOX PAPER
BUT REALLY YOU DO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF TIMIDITY FROM HOUSE DEMOCRATS
REASSURING MELODIOUS VOICE OF SOMEBODY I'D NEVER MET BEGAN TALKING TO ME
SO THE POSTAL SERVICE MAKES MONEY SO TO SPEAK IT COVERS COSTS THROUGH ITS PACKAGE DELIVERY INCLUDING WHERE IT OFFERS DISCOUNTS FOR VERY HIGH VOLUME MAILERS
OH HERE'S A QUESTION THAT I LOVE
AND IT TURNS OUT THIS WAS JUST HOMINUM MIC DISASTER IT'S THE ONE THAT WE WENT TO SOUNDS LIKE SOME
MEMORY HAS ALWAYS WORRIED US SCIENTISTS HAVE WRESTLED FOR CENTURIES WITH WHAT IT IS HOW IT WORKS AND ITS RELIABILITY
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT BOTH CLINICIANS AND FAMILIES AND PEOPLE ON THE SPECTRUM HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH DIFFICULTIES AND HOW THEY CAN PRESENT DIFFERENTLY AND HOW THEY CAN BE SUPPORTED DIFFERENTLY
YEAH THE FREE WORLD IS REALLY NICE IDEA BUT REALLY IF WE'RE NOT THE THING BEHIND IT SORT OF MAKING IT GO
SOMEONE IS ALWAYS WATCHING
SHE HAS FASCINATING ADVICE ON TREATING TECHNOLOGY AS A PERSONAL INVESTIGATION TOOL
IN AUSTRALIA THE EXACT OPPOSITE HAS HAPPENED
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FOLKS BACK TO WORK RIGHT NOW
ONE OF THE KEY THINGS THAT THE AIM HIGH PROJECT RECOGNISES IS THAT COMMUNICATION ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOT ONLY AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF TREATMENT BUT IT'S PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING FOR PEOPLE IN REMOTE COMMUNITIES
DR FIONA BARLOW FROM THE SCHOOL OF PSYCHOLOGY IN QUEENSLAND
AND WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO TRY AND HELP
RABBI JONATHAN SACKS JOHN O'DONOHUE AND ELIZABETH ALEXANDER
YEAH ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE EVERYBODY
IS IS SPACING THIS OUT CHOOSING A DEDICATED PERIOD OF TIME YOU'RE GOING TO WORK ON THIS MAYBE IT'S TWO HOURS A DAY THREE DAYS A WEEK
AND THEN SUDDENLY YOU'RE GETTING TO LIKE A TRULY LIKE FULL FORTY FIVE FORTY SEVEN MINUTES LIKE WOULDN'T EVEN FIT IN AN HOUR OF NETWORK TV
AND SHE WAS JUST A SMALL YOUNG WOMAN
AND YOU DO WANT TO COME OFF CONFIDENT
AND THIS SEEMS AGAIN TO RELATE BETTER TO HEALTH OUTCOMES
MOST OF THE MEDICAL RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON THE HARMS TO THE DRINKERS
HE HAS ALSO SPOKEN AT COCA-COLA SPONSORED SEMINARS
RORY ROBERTSON HAD HIS DOUBTS ABOUT THAT TOO
AT THIRTY THREE YEARS OF AGE
WHICH STARS AN ENSEMBLE CAST OF THEATRE ACTORS FROM HER HOMETOWN CHICAGO
DR JOHN MARSDEN IS AN ECONOMIST AND AUTHOR OF BINGEING COLLATERAL DAMAGE AND THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF TAXING ALCOHOL RATIONALLY
AND I DID IT SO EFFECTIVELY SO WHEN I WENT TO PRISON I KNEW THAT IT WAS LIKE SOME KIND OF MALEVOLENT HIGH SCHOOL
I WISH THAT WE COULD JUST YELL AT THEM AND THEY'D SAY WHOOPS I MAY I MADE A MISTAKE MY BAD
SO FOR PEOPLE WHO COULD BE CALLED RACIST WE FIND THAT A LOT OF RACISM IS EMOTIONAL IT'S ABOUT FEAR AND ANXIETY AND THAT SORT OF STUFF
OR LONGER THE BRAIN IS STILL RECOVERING ITS NORMAL FUNCTION
BUT THEY TREATED EACH MAILING AS IF IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IT WAS EVER DONE
TO GET HER REAL HELP
IT'S NEUTRAL GROUND WHERE THE PERSON CAN FEEL FREE TO FLIRT WHICH IN TURN MIGHT GIVE YOU AN OPENING
YOUR ABILITY TO LEARN FROM IT ISN'T OVER
WE SAW THE SAME WITH BIG TOBACCO WHEN ANY RESEARCH CAME OUT THAT SUPPORTED THEIR BOTTOM LINE
BRAD YES BRADLEY ONEY
SHE WASN'T ABLE TO BE A MOTHER FOR A PORTION OF MY CHILDHOOD BECAUSE SHE HAD TO TAKE CARE OF HERSELF AND YET SAM HAS SOMETHING FROM HIS CHILDHOOD TO FALL BACK ON WHEN THINGS GET HARD
STEPHANIE RUHLE TOLD ME THAT SHE HOPES SO TOO
LIKE SO MANY OF THE PHILIPPINE'S POWERLESS POOR
IT IS INSANE BECAUSE IT'S ONE HUNDRED PERCENT UNTRUE
AND HOW THEY'VE FACED MANY OF THE CHALLENGES THAT COME WITH AN AUTISTIC THINKING STYLE
ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK TIMES
AND SO THAT QUESTION IS THERE AND IT'S REAL
ONE THING THAT'S TRUE IS THAT THERE'S NOT A GOOD REASON
AND HE WAS FUNNY AND HE HAD A GREAT BIG MIND BUT HE HAD A SECOND-GRADE EDUCATION
WE USE THE N WORD UN-BLEEPED JUST A WARNING FOR YOU ALL
A FEW OF THE SUBMISSIONS WERE POETIC
AND THEN AS YOU MOVE TO MORE INTERIOR AREAS SO THE AREAS THAT ARE FURTHER FORWARD IN THE BRAIN
AND THIS IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE THAT AND HALF THE TIME WHATEVER SHE IS SHE HAS AT THE END OF IT
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SHOULD DO
DO YOU THINK THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THE IMPEACHMENT OR OR NOT DO YOU THINK THAT'S JUST NOISE WEEKLY NOISE IT'S DEFINITELY NOT JUST NOISE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DYING
SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND WHAT I EXPECT BOB WILL DO IS
I'M A LIVING EXAMPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE BOOK SOLD BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY THOUSAND COPIES SO FAR
THEY INCLUDE FRONT GROUPS
YOU DON'T NEED TO GIVE A LOT OF BACKSTORY AND IN FACT IF YOU GIVE A LOT OF BACKSTORY
AND PETER FRIED WANTED THERE TO BE AN ENTITY THAT COULD TAKE THE PLACE OF RECOVERED MEMORY AND SO WHAT THEY CAME UP WITH WAS FALSE MEMORY SYNDROME INSTEAD OF RECOVERED MEMORY SYNDROME
WE KNOW THAT SUICIDE RATES FOR ABORIGINAL PEOPLE IN GENERAL ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN FOR NON-ABORIGINAL PEOPLE AND IN THE LAST DECADE THE RATES OF SUICIDE FOR ABORIGINAL MEN HAS INCREASED FOURTEEN-FOLD
THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK IT MAKES QUITE CLEAR IS THAT EVEN WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK OF AS A FAIRLY SIMPLE TASK LIKE RECOGNISING A FACE
HE WAS PUSHING THIS CONSPIRACY THEORY OF THE COLONISTS BEING ENSLAVED WHEN THE COLONISTS THEMSELVES WERE ENSLAVING PEOPLE YEAH IT'S VERY MESSED UP

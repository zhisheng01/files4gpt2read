ONE STATE LAWMAKER IS PUSHING TO CHANGE THAT
THESE TWO HAVE HAD A VERY STRONG RELATIONSHIP OVER THE PAST YEAR
THAT WAS REALLY REWARDING
FOR EXAMPLE YOU WILL BE FILTERING OUT OTHER SENSORY INPUTS SO THAT YOU CAN FOCUS ON THE ONE VOICE THAT YOU ARE LISTENING TO
MY FIRST REACTION TO THAT IS YOU DIDN'T WASTE THAT TIME
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T FOCUS ON THE EXACT ACTIONS EVERYONE SEEMS KIND OF REASONABLE AND CARING
TODAY WE'LL HEAR THEIR EXPERIENCE OF BEING ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM
THE MINISTRY WILL RUN TRIALS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS SELF-DRIVING TAXIS AND SMART ROADS THAT SUPPORT AUTONOMOUS DRIVING
I'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU DO
SHE IS CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH DRUG COURT BUT AFTER GOING THROUGH THIS STUFF FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW
SO THIS IS A DEBATE IT'S A CONTEST THERE WILL BE WINNERS AND THERE WILL BE LOSERS
AND BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC MORE THAN HALF THE ELECTORATE COULD WIND UP MAKING THEIR PICK FOR PRESIDENT THROUGH THE MAIL THIS NOVEMBER
AND AS SUCH ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT WANT TO CRITICALLY ENGAGE TODAY
AND I'M JUSTAS HAPPY TO HAVE PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE WORKING
AT WHICH POINT AS SHE SAYS
NEXT
MY JOB IS TO KEEP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAFE AND TO CREATE A PLATFORM
I MEET HIM AT A CHURCH-RUN FOOD PROGRAM FOR POOR KIDS
I THINK WHAT IT IS IS A GREAT POP SONG AS OPPOSED TO A MEANINGFUL ROCK SONG
A REALLY HUGE GRASS ROOTS NETWORK OF FAMILIES WHO HAD BEEN AFFECTED BY THESE COMPLAINTS
INVOLVES RESTRUCTURING THE BANKS THEMSELVES HOW THEY WORK INTERNALLY
TAKE A FEW BEAUTIFUL BREATHS
THINK ABOUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT
SO IT'S BEEN CONFLICTING
I ACTUALLY THINK THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE'RE HAVING PROBLEMS IN THE U S ESPECIALLY CONVINCING PEOPLE TO SOCIALLY DISTANCE
AND ALSO JUST
YES I DO THINK THAT IS THE CASE AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I NECESSARILY EXPECTED AT ALL WHEN I STARTED OUT THE RESEARCH BUT I CAME TO SEE THAT THEY WERE PARTICIPATING IN A SOCIAL WORLD IN THE CLOZAPINE CLINIC WHICH THEY COULDN'T EASILY DO OUTSIDE OF IT
BUT THERE ARE SEVENTY NINE MILLION MORE OF THEM
HE CAN DO THESE THINGS BUT IT IS A VERY STICKY AREA BECAUSE HE HAS TO BE SURE THAT IT'S NOT POLITICALLY MOTIVATED AND THAT IT ALSO THAT IT DOESN'T INVOLVE AREAS THAT IMPACT HIM DIRECTLY
UNDER CURRENT LAW BECAUSE OF PROGRAM INSOLVENCY
THIS WAS A REALLY INTENSE TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY YEAH SO MUCH WAS GOING ON
FOR OTHER PEOPLE THEY WILL HAVE TROUBLE TELLING APART OTHER SIMILAR OBJECTS
AND WHY IS AMERICA'S LEADING HEALTH LAW EXPERT SO DISMAYED BY HIS COUNTRY'S RESPONSE
IF I CAN DO THOSE THINGS
I THINK THAT THE STATISTICS AROUND PEOPLE ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM HAVING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE QUITE HORRENDOUS
ESSENTIALLY I HAD GONE FROM BEING ENTIRELY NEGATIVELY FOCUSED TO BEING PRETTY MUCH ENTIRELY POSITIVELY FOCUSED AND THAT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE
I'VE BEEN READING A LOT ABOUT CONSPIRACY THEORIES FOR A WHILE
AND I STARTED TO WALK OUT OF THE ROOM
BE PROFESSIONAL
I THINK THAT MAIL-IN VOTING IS A TERRIBLE THING
THE EXPERIENCE OF READING IT THEN FOR THE KIND OF PRECIOUSNESS OR INFLUENCE OF THE AUTHOR OR IT HAD SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY OR THEN THERE ARE OTHER BOOKS WHERE
HOW TO PLAN YOUR TIME DURING A DAY TO MOVE UP THE RANKS IN YOUR OFFICE
SO WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO SEE FACES MORE AS WHOLES TEND TO BE BETTER AT RECOGNISING FACES
I ASKED HER ABOUT HER EARLY IMPRESSIONS
SCREAMING THAT SANTA CLAUS HAS CHASED HIM ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE CITY WITH A BASEBALL BAT
JEANETTE PURKIS
YES THAT'S WHAT WE EXPLORE WE EXPLORE PUTTING WINE TO THE EXISTING BEER RATE
AND SO YOU'VE APPEALED THAT DENIAL RIGHT
SO HOW DOES HE THINK HIS STORY MIGHT HELP OTHERS
RENE SAYS HER INTERACTIONS WITH ADMINISTRATORS ABOUT HER TIME TEACHING BROUGHT BACK CHILDHOOD TRAUMA AND IT WENT RIGHT TO HOW MY MOTHER WOULD TREAT ME
AND THEN THE OTHER GUY SAID
CHECK YOUR EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK
HE SETTLED ON THE WORD ROBOT A WORD HE AND HIS BROTHER ALSO A NOTED WRITER MADE UP
HAVE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS RESPONDED ACCORDINGLY
THOSE ATTEMPTS HAVE FAILED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
BUT THE THE WILLINGNESS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION TO GET KICKED IN THE JUNK REPEATEDLY AND LET THAT BE SOMETHING THAT DELIVERS FOR THE KREMLIN
MENTAL HEALTH NURSE MARY MALONEY
I DO YES
SO HIS CAMPAIGN HAD BEEN ACTIVE HE HAD BEEN SINKING A LITTLE BIT IN THE POLLS BUT HE'D BEEN EXTREMELY ACTIVE CAMPAIGNER
BUT WE SHOULD REALLY START BY DEFINING WHAT A CONSPIRACY THEORY IS IN THE FIRST PLACE
WHAT DID I JUST HEAR
AN EDUCATED MAN AND A CHILD OF PRIVILEGE
IF YOU HAD TO MAKE A PRAGMATIC JUDGMENT AS TO WHAT YOU COULD DO ABOUT IT
AND LET'S NOT FORGET THE MUCH-MALIGNED MOM JEANS
WHICH THEY SAY THEY MIGHT ONE DAY
FIONA BARLOW STUDIES THE FACTORS THAT DETERMINE HOW RACIALLY PREJUDICED PEOPLE ARE
HOW THEY TREAT OUR ARMIES HOW THEY TREAT CIVILIANS ABROAD ABSOLUTELY AND IT COMPLETELY JIBE WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
SO THE LITMUS TEST OF WISDOM IS NOT JUST WHAT IS CONTAINED IN THAT PERSON BUT THEIR IMPRINT ON THE WORLD
WE GOT DATA FROM OUR STUDIES IN-HOUSE AT THE CANCER COUNCIL WE GOT DATA FROM THE US OF THE RISKS A YEAR AFTER THEIR CANCER DIAGNOSIS
AND THOSE FOLKS MIGHT ARGUE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE HEMORRHAGING MONEY NO ONE'S GETTING SNAIL MAIL ANYWAY
I'M NOT TRYING TO WIN YOU OVER
A CATALYST FOR EMPOWERED HEALTHY AND FULFILLED LIVES
THE NUMBERS OF RATS WITH CANCER WERE ALL VERY LOW ALL IN THE SINGLE DIGITS
SHE TOLD ME ABOUT HER WORKING DAY
IT IS THEIR RIGHT
YOU WANT TO BE CLEAR YOU WANT TO BE CONCISE
AND TAKING A STEP EVEN FURTHER BACK TO ME
FREDDY SITAS IS DIRECTOR OF CANCER RESEARCH AT THE CANCER COUNCIL THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS TO BE GAINED BY QUITTING SMOKING AT ANY POINT IN YOUR LIFE INCLUDING AFTER A SERIOUS DIAGNOSIS LIKE CANCER
OF COURSE MOST OF US ARE SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES
ONLY INTENSIFIED ADAMS' CONSPIRACY THEORY SURE HIS THEORY WAS SUPPORTED BY SOME ACTS OF BRITISH AGGRESSION
THE PROFIT CENTER IS THE TRADING DESK
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT
I WILL NEVER LET OUR POST OFFICE FAIL
ALL THAT DA WILL DO A PROSECUTOR WOULD DO IS PLAY THAT VIDEO TURN TO THE JURY AND GO RIGHT HERE
MANY PEOPLE SAID THEY WAITED UNTIL THEIR RELATIONSHIP SEEMED SOLID
SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING A LOT OF EFFORT ON IN EPIC NOW IS FUNCTIONAL HEALTH MEASURING OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONAL HEALTH QUALITY OF LIFE
CONTRIBUTING TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT WEAVE REVERENCE RECIPROCITY AND RESILIENCE INTO THE FABRIC OF MODERN LIFE THE HENRY LUCE FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT OF PUBLIC THEOLOGY REIMAGINED AND THE OSPREY FOUNDATION
AND IN THE PROCESS OF SPENDING ABOUT TWO WEEKS IN THE STUDIO TOGETHER
I WAS SIMPLY ROBBED
I MEAN IT WAS INSANE
YOU'RE STUART TOO
MORGAN FLANNERY
EVERYTHING I SAY HAS MORE WEIGHT THAN WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS GOING TO SAY
IT'S ALL ABOUT TAKEAWAYS TIPS TRICKS HACKS WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO LEARN IN THIS SIXTY SECOND TAYSTEE VIDEO ABOUT HOW TO MAKE BROWNIES YOU KNOW
WHO BUILT THEM
BUT BEFORE SHE DID
BEFORE SHE KNEW SHE WAS ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM
YOU KNOW BEING NUTS ABOUT WHATEVER WAS REALLY SERIOUS WORK TO THROW U S RESOURCES INTO THE REGION
A NEW NATION WAS BORN
WHO WOULD THAT PERSON BE

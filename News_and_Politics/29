THAT OF COURSE THE REGULAR MEDIA TENDS TO JUMP OVER
I KNOW IT'S A
VIGNETTES ON THE MYSTERY AND ART OF LIVING
THE NIGHT BEFORE RENE NEARLY KILLED HERSELF
I HAD TO REALLY BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT THAT CHALLENGE IS CLOSE TO HOME
THE INDICATOR IS A PRODUCTION OF NPR
WE HAVE WITH OURSELVES OR THE MOST IMPORTANT CONNECTION YOU HAVE WITH TECHNOLOGY IS THE ONE WITH YOURSELF
HE CAME ON TO TALK ABOUT LEADERSHIP AND COMMAND STRUCTURES IN THE U S AND HOW THEY INFLUENCE THE ACTIONS OF TERRORIST GROUPS ABROAD INCLUDING HOW THEY TREAT HOSTAGES
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE STRONGEST THINGS THAT HAVE COME THROUGH FOR YOU PERSONALLY IN TERMS OF RACIAL BIAS AGAINST YOU OR YOUR FAMILY
INSURANCE CO-PAYS CAN BE EXTREMELY HIGH WHEN IT COMES TO IN-PATIENT TREATMENT AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T HAVE INSURANCE
YOU STARTED A COMPANY
IF THEY SCREW UP AND MAKE A BAD BET THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO NEED TO BE BAILED OUT BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT TO HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CAPITAL ON HAND
SHE WANTS TO GIVE HER SON SOME MONEY
RIGHT OR WHILE I'M YOUNG I'LL BE FINE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
THAT THERE'S ALSO ALWAYS BEEN THIS
MEDITATION EXPERIENCE
YOU KNOW THE GREATEST SNACK FOOD EVER CREATED
AND ACTUALLY
NAKED CAME THE STRANGER
THE PRESIDENT THREATENED HE WOULD MAKE SENATOR LEILA DE LIMA CRY
THE NIGHTLY NEWS BRITAIN'S GOT TALENT WHATEVER THAT'S CALLED
WHAT'S THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MOTIVATOR THAT MOTIVATES US TO FAVOUR OUR IN-GROUP RATHER THAN ANOTHER GROUP
WHO HAS NO FRIENDS
IT IS CALLED THE KING IS ALWAYS ABOVE THE PEOPLE
I THINK IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARILY INTERESTING TIME RIGHT NOW BECAUSE SO MANY DIFFERENT FIELDS ARE TALKING TO EACH OTHER IN WAYS THAT THEY NEVER DID BEFORE
I GET VERY SCARED I GET NASTY HALLUCINATIONS AND SYMPTOMS AND DELUSIONAL THINKING VERY FREQUENTLY MY LIFE IS A BIG DIFFICULTY TO MANAGE THAT ON TOP OF THE AUTISM AND EVERYTHING THAT GOES WITH THAT
AND THEY'RE FILMED IN THEIR OWN HOMES WATCHING THE SAME EPISODES OF THE SAME SHOWS SO FOR EXAMPLE LIKE THE VENERABLE SOAP OPERA EASTENDERS
THEY ARE CELEBRATING THAT ANTHOLOGY WITH A TERRIFIC SERIES OF FREE EVENTS IN NEW YORK D C SAN FRANCISCO AND PHOENIX
SPLIT BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYEE
IT'S A REALLY AMAZING TIME TO MAKE NEW RELATIONSHIPS THAT CAN SERVE YOU
COUNTERTERRORISM
THERE ARE FIVE STATES
THE PRICES ARE UP BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE CHASING THAT YIELD
WE ARE BACK YOU'RE LISTENING TO IT'S BEEN A MINUTE FROM NPR THE SHOW WHERE WE CATCH UP ON THE WEEK THAT WAS
BUT I LOVED IT
YOU THINK SOCIAL SECURITY IS GOING INSOLVENT ON THE BASIS OF THAT
OPPONENTS OF PRESIDENT DUTERTE SAY THE NATION'S HUMANITY IS NOW AT STAKE
LET US GO TO COCKTAIL CHATTER
AND THERE WERE OVERT THINGS I WAS LEARNING ABOUT GOD FROM HIM
SOPHIE'S TROUBLES STARTED AT THE AGE OF TWELVE
A MAJOR SOURCE OF DISINFORMATION ABOUT THE FIVE G NETWORK HAS BEEN THE RUSSIAN TV NETWORK
SO THE IDEA WAS THAT IT WOULD BE STUDIED BY SCIENTISTS BY PSYCHOLOGISTS AND SOCIOLOGISTS AND POLITICALLY AND CULTURALLY IT WOULD BE CHALLENGED
WE THEN MADE A DEAL WITH THE AMERICAN WORKERS
IN IT IN A DIFFERENT REGISTER THAN YOU CAN GET MANY OTHER PLACES AND SOME OF THEM ALSO MAKE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN THAT CHANGED THAT WORLD EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT WRITING BREAKING NEWS PARTLY BECAUSE THEY ARE ABLE TO BACK UP AND GET THE BIG PICTURE
AND I SAID LISTEN WE'RE TALKING TO LISTENERS THAT ARE DEALING WITH CRAZY WAIT TIMES
WORSE THAN ALCOHOL
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE INEVITABLY ARE GOING TO END UP AS MY AGE
IT HAPPENS AT THE MOMENT THROUGH A VOLUMETRIC EXCISE ON ALL ALCOHOL EXCEPT WINE
I THINK THE KIDS FOR A LONG TIME DURING THIS TRIP VIEWED IT AS SOMETHING WE DID TO THEM AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING WE WERE DOING TOGETHER
NORMALLY
SITES OF INDOCTRINATION OF CULTURE AND SORT OF HOMOGENIZATION
THE ABILITY TO RECOGNISE FACES IN PARTICULAR IS QUITE SPECIFIC AND COMPLEX
AND IT HAS YET TO BE PUBLISHED BUT IT'S SO GOOD IT WILL MAKE IT TO COMING TO A MAGAZINE NEAR YOU
WHO REALLY PEOPLE WHO REALLY WANT TO ADDRESS THIS BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE VOTES IN ONE PLACE OR ANOTHER
SURPRISINGLY
SO RIGHT NOW I THINK WE'RE STILL AT A MALLEABLE TIME WHERE YOU CAN CHANGE PEOPLE'S MINDS BECAUSE IT CAN BE SOMETHING THAT BRIDGES POLITICAL DIVIDE
IT RANGES FROM QUESTIONS ABOUT WELLBEING QUESTIONS ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS QUESTIONS ABOUT STIGMA HELP-SEEKING
HE PUSHES BACK REALLY REALLY HARD AGAINST ANY SORT OF VICTIM NARRATIVE
SO ONE THING THAT I STARTED THINKING ABOUT IN THE WRITING OF THE BOOK IS ABOUT
AND THEN THE CONTENT
SO IF THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES WITH DECEPTION AND WITH MEMORY
I THINK THAT MAY BE THE FIRST TIME I HEARD MY MOTHER SAY SEX IT A COUPLE DAYS BEFORE I TALKED TO MARILYN I WENT TO THE ARCHIVES AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY
WE SEE THIS ALSO IN THE TRIALS OF BLOOD PRESSURE TREATMENT FOR EXAMPLE
CERTAINLY
WE NEEDED A WOMAN WHO MIGHT FIT THE NAME THEY DECIDED ON MIKE'S SISTER IN LAW
MORE FROM DR KARL LATER
BUT WE WERE BEING A BIT FACETIOUS TOO WE WERE REALLY TRYING TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT START THEIR PAPERS WITH THIS SENTENCE THEY SAY THAT
THEY ALSO LOOKED AT THE US RESEARCH AND AGAIN FOUND THE LINK BETWEEN WEIGHT GAIN AND SUGARY DRINKS IN CHILDREN WAS PROBABLE
MATERIALLY INCREASE A LOT OF CONSPIRACY THINKING THIS IS KATHRYN OLMSTED
HE NEVER LIKED HER
SO YOU'VE LOOKED AT BOTH THE MENTAL HEALTH ILL EFFECTS ON PEOPLE WHO ARE VICTIMS OF RACISM
BUT HE WORRIES IT'S TOO LATE FOR HIM I THINK A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH MY LACK OF FURTHER EDUCATION
WELL I THINK IN MY OWN PATH I FOLLOWED EACH STEP OF THE WAY AND CONTINUE TO FOLLOW WHERE THE GOODS ARE
IS GETTING A BETTER CAREER BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO BUILD A REAL LIFE WHEN YOU'RE WORKING NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS
AND JEREMY NOTICED A NEW SKILL DEVELOPING AS HIS SON MATURED HE WAS TERRIBLE AT HANDWRITING BUT HE'S NOW ABLE TO GET HIS THOUGHTS HE VERBALIZES THAT'S WHAT HE DOES NOW YOU KNOW
AND SO ONE THING THAT I WOULD THINK ABOUT IN THIS PROCESS TOO
CURIOUS ANACHRONISMS RIGHT I MEAN ENGLAND IS A KIND OF SINGLE FAMILY RIGHT ENCOMPASSING CLASSES
IT DIDN'T MAKE MOST COLONISTS WANT TO LEAVE THE BRITISH EMPIRE AT ALL OK SO WHAT ACTUALLY MADE THEM TURN AGAINST THE CROWN
SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE A FEW ARGUMENTS THAT CAN BE PERSUASIVE ONCE YOU GET IT ON THIS KIND OF MORE POSITIVE FOOTING AND ALSO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHY THEY DON'T THINK IT MATTERS
IF THE INVESTIGATOR FINDS THERE IS A CASE TO ANSWER
PROFESSOR YIN PARADIES CONDUCTS RESEARCH ON THE HEALTH SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF RACISM AT DEAKIN UNIVERSITY
WE CANNOT AVOID THE ISSUE OF SOCIAL SECURITY INSOLVENCY
HIS FATHER HAS STOPPED TALKING TO HIM
IT IS A CONSERVATIVE FORECAST OF ECONOMIC GROWTH
ABSOLUTELY YEAH I THINK INTERGENERATIONAL TRAUMA AND ACTUALLY RISING TO MEET IT ALSO LIKE BEING RESILIENT THAT'S JUST AN EXTREMELY AMERICAN STORY
IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN
NOW MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA HAVE BEEN ASKING POINTED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE APPROPRIATENESS OF USING THE PHRASE CHINA VIRUS
MY PAPER HAS NOT BEEN CRITICISED BY ANY SCIENTIST
AND INTERACT WITH THEM IN A DIFFERENT WAY WHEN PEOPLE COME TO THE COURT THEY'RE ALWAYS IN TROUBLE
WHEN I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL THINGS GOT VERY BAD
I'M SAM SANDERS AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
DANNY IF YOU WERE TO CALL SOMEONE TOMORROW WHO SEEMS LIKE YOU AND IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE HAPPY AT THEIR JOB
HEAD TO THE ALL IN THE MIND WEBSITE FOR MORE INFORMATION RELATED TO TODAY
I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED ALREADY I MEAN THIS IS MONTHS AGO
SHE DENIES THE TAPE IS REAL
I REACHED OUT FOR SOME HELP AFTER FINALLY REALIZING THAT IT WASN'T JUST NEW-MOM BLUES THIS LAST YEAR THERE'S SOMETHING MORE GOING ON
IT'S SOMETHING THAT A HUGE NUMBER OF US HAVE GROWN I GOTTA SAY ADDICTED TO AND THE SHOCK AND DISGUST OF DISINFORMATION STORIES ALWAYS ABOUT CHILD RAPE AND TRY TO HEAR THAT EXPRESSION AND NOT HAVE IT CONJURE AN INCREDIBLY UPSETTING CRIMINAL AND VIOLENT SCENARIO TOWARD A CHILD
PRESIDENT DUTERTE MET WITH HIS PARENTS PROMISING SWIFT ACTION WOULD BE TAKEN
IT WAS THEN THAT I BEGAN TO SENSE THAT IT WAS GOING TO WORK
HE SAT AND STOOD AND BOWED ATOP A PLATFORM OF BATTERIES WHICH POWERED HIS ACTIONS

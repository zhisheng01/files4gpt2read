WHEAT GRASS
THAT'S NOT A GOOD DEAL
SOFT DRINKS SEEM TO BE IN THE FIRING LINE AS SOME SORT OF UNIQUE CONTRIBUTOR TO OBESITY
THE ONE THAT I SORT OF WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT REGRETTING THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ON THERE IS CALLED AT DAY'S CLOSE NIGHT IN TIMES PAST BY A ROGER EKIRCH
WELL THE INTERESTING THING IS IT TURNED OUT TO BE REALLY HARD TO CONCLUSIVELY DISPROVE WHAT SHE SAID
AS WE SAY
WHILE THERE YOU INSTITUTED A PROGRAM THAT EXTENDED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO MOST OF THE KIDS IN THE STATE AND YOU CUT TAXES
TERRIBLE THAT THERE WERE SOME FOLKS WHO THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO PRETEND LIKE THEY WERE SERVING OUR VETERANS WHEN IN FACT THEY WERE NOT AND HUGE WAIT TIMES FOR FOLKS TO GET IN
THE DECAPITATED HEAD OF CHARLOTTE CORDAY WAS SEEN TO BLUSH AFTER BEING SLAPPED BY THE EXECUTIONER
I'M TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE HEART DISEASE DIABETES AND DEPRESSION
WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRANTS PEOPLE WHO WERE DISPLACED BY WAR OR DISASTER
I DON'T THINK ANYONE SHOULD GET A NEW JOB AT AGE SEVENTY EIGHT
ALL THESE YEARS OF THIS CUMULATIVE CONVERSATION TO ME THAT
SO AFTER THESE REPORTERS HAD COMBED THE COUNTRYSIDE OF IRELAND IN SEARCH OF EVIDENCE FOR OR AGAINST BRIDEY AND WHILE PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA WERE DOING THESE COPYCAT EXPERIMENTS TO FIND THEIR OWN PASTS
DO YOU BOTH UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THE RISKS
INTELLIGENT
WELL LIKE YEAH THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE TRUE YOU KNOW THAT THE SOVIET UNION HAS BEEN ECONOMICALLY COLLAPSING FOR SEVENTY FIVE YEARS AND SOMEHOW THAT WHOLE TIME HAS BEEN A THREAT GLOBALLY
UN-THOUGHT OF UNPRECEDENTED THINGS OCCUR
AND THERE IS A SOMATIC CORRELATE TO THAT ENERGETIC OF PUSHING FORWARD AND I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY AND HERE'S HOW WE SHOULD DO IT AND I KNOW THE RIGHT WAY
SOPHIE ENDED UP ON CRYSTAL METH I STARTED SMOKING IT AND THEN THAT PROGRESSED TO SHOOTING IT BECAUSE I JUST WANTED TO GO HARD
AS AN AUTISTIC I DON'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING OR DOING
A NON-PROFIT INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATION
AND YET HE'S SAYING BASICALLY THESE RULES WE OPERATE BY
VERY AFFIRMING YEAH AND I WILL SAY
AND HOW TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THAT AND HOW WE CAN ALL GET MORE REAL ABOUT THAT AND GET BEHIND THE CURTAIN IF YOU WILL BECAUSE I THINK WHEN WE DO THAT
AND ONCE THE INTERVIEW IS OVER REMEMBER
SO IT'S KIND OF A QUESTION OF WHETHER THE RACIAL ENVIRONMENT IMPACTS EVERYONE
EXPAND YOUR NETWORK BY MAKING REAL AUTHENTIC CONNECTIONS
OR IS IT UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL
WHY WORRY
HE WASN'T CONSIDERED A SERIOUS CONTENDER
OVER THE PAST YEAR MORE THAN ONE MILLION PEOPLE HAVE COME FORWARD TO ADMIT THEIR DRUG USE IN THE HOPE IT WILL SAVE THEM FROM BEING A VICTIM IN THE DRUG WAR RAGING ACROSS THE COUNTRY
SO WE REALLY WANTED TO SAY THE OPPOSITE
PROMISING BEGINNING
ONLY FOR THE MALE RATS
SO THAT IS A WRAP EXCEPT WE DO HAVE TO LET GO OF ONE MORE THING OR PERSON AND THAT IS TIM MAK
AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT EVEN THE MOST PROBLEMATIC OF THE CHARACTERS IN THIS FILM HAS TURNED A CORNER TO MAKE THEIR LIFE MORE STABLE AND MORE MEANINGFUL
THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE
THEY DIDN'T RESPOND
NOT BEING TOTALLY PHYSICALLY INACTIVE THAT IS EVEN HAVING A STANDING OCCUPATION OR HALF AN HOUR OF JOGGING OR SWIMMING A DAY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY MODERATE ALCOHOL THAT IS
ONE PERCENT OF GDP YOU THINK WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT
BUT AT FIRST WE CAN'T HEAR MADISON
BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S THAT THE GOVERNORS ARE NOT GETTING THE KIND OF IMMEDIATE BLOWBACK THAT WOULD NORMALLY COME WHEN A POLITICIAN REALLY MISSTEPS WHEN HE OR SHE ENDORSES A MISTAKEN POLICY
SOMEBODY WAS POISONING THE ALCOHOL
IT'S ALSO PASSING DOWN TRADITIONS
FOR EXAMPLE
I REALIZED THAT HE COULD HELP ME WITH MY MEDITATION PRACTICE IN A WAY THAT I REALLY NEEDED
OUR THEME MUSIC IS BY HANNAH BROWN
WOULD I RUIN MY REPUTATION THESE ARE THINGS ANDREA GRYCH WISHES SHE'D CONSIDERED

SHE DRANK A LOT
MANY BELIEVE SHE WAS FRAMED
PROFESSOR BRAD DUCHAINE FROM PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES AT DARTMOUTH COLLEGE IN THE US
WE SHOULD FEEL REAL URGENCY TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS AND TAKE ON THESE REFORMS BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT OUR ECONOMIC FUTURE AND OUR ECONOMIC PROSPERITY
VIBRATING IN HER ENVIRONMENT OR VIBRATING HER ENVIRONMENT
SO FOR SOME PEOPLE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO BE TAKING MEDICATION TO MANAGE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH DIFFICULTIES

YES THERE WERE TWO THINGS WE THINK THAT MAY HAVE HELPED OUR IDENTIFICATION OF BEHAVIOURS
AND EVEN D L HUGHLEY HIMSELF WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS STUFF BACK IN THE DAY
MEANING A PENSION PLAN
IS THERE ANY OTHER MEDICATION I CAN TAKE OTHER THAN TABLETS
FIND THESE AND ALL BECOMING WISE EPISODES BY SUBSCRIBING ON ITUNES STITCHER OR SOUNDCLOUD
BUT HE WAS VERY CLEAR OF THE CANDIDATES ALSO HE WAS THE CLEAREST IN TERMS OF WHAT HE WANTED TO ACHIEVE HE SPOKE LIKE A CEO
BUT LET'S SAY THERE ARE NO RULES OR FEW OF THEM
HONOR THE OTHER PERSON'S WISHES AND MAKE IT AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO SAY NO
SO I HANDED HER A COPY
THE DEBATE HAS LARGELY CENTERED ON FAIRNESS AND SOLVENCY
BUT THAT'S NOT QUITE TRUE
I WANTED NOTHING
I NEVER HAD A SUPERHERO

YOU KNOW MANIPULATE PEOPLE'S OUTRAGE I GUESS THE ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS I MEAN IT WORKED
AND I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT WISDOM REALLY IS
SHE WAS HAVING STEERING COLUMN ISSUES THAT WOULD'VE COST HER OVER FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS AT THE SHOP
EVEN ACROSS THE CENTURIES

AND IT WILL HAVE A BIGGER EFFECT
BUT IT ISN'T EASY BECAUSE PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE COMPLEX

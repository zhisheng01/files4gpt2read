THESE DAYS HE SAYS
I'M CURIOUS WHAT WERE THE SURPRISES ON THE LIST
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A BUSINESS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT
AND THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A SOURCE OF WEAKNESS IT CAN BE A SOURCE OF STRENGTH AND SO LIKE I THINK FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DEALING WITH BEING THEY'RE DEALING WITH THE WEIGHT OF TRAUMA THAT GOES BACK FARTHER THAN THEIR OWN BIRTH THAT SORT OF MODEL OF TRADITION CAN BE EXTREMELY EMPOWERING
RETHINK SUGARY DRINKS IS PART OF A CONCERTED HEALTH CAMPAIGN TO RAISE PUBLIC AWARENESS
THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE US LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE
WE SPOKE RECENTLY BEFORE AN AUDIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT SANTA BARBARA
AND IT DOESN'T ALWAYS COME IN THE PACKAGE YOU EXPECT IT TO COME
SOMETIMES IF THEY'RE DUE FOR THEIR NEEDLES WE BRING THEM TO THE CLINIC
USING THE MOST APPROPRIATE RECORDING TECHNOLOGY METAPHOR SAID THIS IS A FLASHBULB MEMORY
AND IT'S ACTUALLY OFTEN IN A CRISIS THAT PEOPLE MOST FORGET THEMSELVES IN THE BEST WAY
SO YOU KNOW THAT WAS DEFINITELY ADDED TO THE STRESS OF
AND YET THEY HAVE A REALLY TOUGH TIME RECOGNISING PEOPLE THAT THEY KNOW IN DAILY LIFE
AND TO HAVE EXPOSURE TO NEW STRUCTURES OF WORK KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION AND INFRASTRUCTURE
SET A TONE AT THE TOP OF ACCOUNTABILITY
THE U S HAS SEEN A SLOW BUT STEADY INCREASE IN MAIL-IN VOTING
THAT IS WE THINK WE HAVE A CONTINUOUS ACCESS TO OUR ORIGINAL EXPERIENCES LIKE I THINK I CAN REMEMBER A BIRTHDAY PARTY THAT I HAD WITH MY DAD WHEN I WAS FIVE
IS THAT YOU HAVE ONE OF YOUR GUESTS TALKING ABOUT HURRICANE KATRINA
HE'S A STUDENT THERE SHE IS THE TEACHER THERE
GREG JOHNSON IS THE CEO OF DIABETES AUSTRALIA
IT'S THE CAMBRIDGE FACE MEMORY TEST
AND I'M NOT THAT INTERESTED IN FAITH
SO THE ONLY PERSON THAT THE YOUNG MENTALLY ILL PERSON HAS A RELATIONSHIP WITH IS HIS MOTHER
DIFFERENT MEANS OF AGGRESSION DIFFERENT TACTICS DIFFERENT MEANS OF CONFRONTING US
THESE REPORTS SHOWED THAT THE BRAIN LIVED FOR A WHILE AFTER THE HEAD WAS CHOPPED OFF
AND THAT IS THE REALITY
IS DIFFICULTIES AROUND SOCIAL COMMUNICATION AND NON-VERBAL CUES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
AND I SAID
THESE ARE THINGS THAT DO AFFECT ALL AGE GROUPS
SHE IS DENIED ANY ACCESS TO MEDIA EXCEPT FOR TWO NEWSPAPERS A DAY BUT SHE IS NOT ALLOWED TELEVISION
AND SO THE WAY HE LIVES HIS LIFE WHERE HE CHOOSES TO LIVE IT HOW HE CHOOSES TO BE EDUCATED HOW HE CHOOSES TO INTERACT WITH PEOPLE THOSE ARE ALL THEY'RE PART OF MAKING A NEW TRADITION AND THEY'RE THINGS THAT HE DRAWS STRENGTH FROM RATHER THAN TRYING TO FIT HIMSELF INTO
THEY DO PISS ME OFF
HENCE SHE HERSELF HAS LESS WEAR AND TEAR ON HER NERVOUS SYSTEMS AS SHE HAS BOTH LESS WORK AND LESS WORRY
WHICH IS TO ASK MYSELF WHEN I'M ENGAGED IN
IF YOU GO OUT LOOKING LIKE THAT EVEN TODAY
WHEN I GET TO SPEAK DIRECTLY WITH SENATOR DE LIMA AS I AM NOT ALLOWED TO RECORD THE INTERVIEW WE MAKE SOME NOTES
AND AS SUCH
REALLY
I THINK I'M PROBABLY A ROMANTIC IN THAT BELIEF BECAUSE LOOK AT WHEN NATURAL DISASTERS HIT
THEY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THINGS LIKE SEXUAL HARASSMENT FAVORITISM
SO MY PSYCHOLOGIST FRIENDS SAY THERE'S NO WAY THAT THIS CAN BE A MEMORY BECAUSE IT'S TOO EARLY
AND ON THE ONE HAND YOU SAW THAT GREAT SURPRISE OF THE WALL COMING DOWN
HE WAS THE SAND AND THE SEA AND THE STAR PIERCED THE SKY
YOUR FAMILY IS AT RISK FOR INTERGENERATIONAL TRAUMA
BACKGROUND BRIEFING ASKED PROFESSOR JENNIE BRAND-MILLER WHAT LINES OF EVIDENCE SHE RELIED ON
MUCH LIKE THEY ALREADY HAVE WITH TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL
AND THEN ONCE WE DID EILEEN MYLES IN ORDER TO FORCE ME TO RECKON WITH THE GREATNESS OF A MORE CONTEMPORARY FIGURE
I CAN TELL BY THE WAY WHAT A GOOD LISTENER YOU ARE BECAUSE USUALLY WHEN I'M SITTING IN THIS CHAIR
IN THIS INSTANCE WE HAD AN UNINTERRUPTED NINETY MINUTES AND IT REALLY FELT LIKE AN EXPLORATION AND AT THE END OF THE NINETY MINUTES I HAD TO TELL THIS PERSON I HAD NEVER SEEN THAT THIS HAD BEEN THE MOST SOULFUL SEARCHING INTIMATE CONVERSATION I COULD REMEMBER HAVING
VERITIES THAT THE WORLD TRADITIONS POINT TO THAT WE CAN LIVE IN OUR INDIVIDUAL LIVES HOW DO WE LIVE IT COLLECTIVELY IN OUR ORGANIZATIONAL LIVES
A LOT OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY BELIEVED THIS STORY
SOME OF THESE NEW TAX CUTS HAVE TO BE PAID FOR
IT WILL BE UP FOR THE CHALLENGE THIS FALL
SUGAR CONSUMPTION HAS GONE DOWN AND OBESITY HAS GONE UP
SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL AND SHE DESERVED TO LIVE
ENTERTAINMENT AND CULTURAL EXPERIENCES WERE AS MUCH THE DRIVERS AS EFFICIENCY GAINS OR PRODUCTIVITY
IT'S BEEN A BIG UNDERTAKING BUT LOTS OF BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A WHOLE LOT MORE MONEY BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT MARGINS RIGHT THE POSTAL SERVICE DOESN'T CHANGE THEIR PRICING THEY'RE COMMITTED TO THEIR SET PRICING SCHEDULE AND THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
PEOPLE WHO THINK HE'S GOING TO BE
THREE
BUT IT'S AN INDICATION OF DEPRESSION IN TYPICAL PEOPLE
A POPULAR TELEVISION SERIES WITH A MAIN CHARACTER SUFFERING FROM SCHIZOPHRENIA THAT IS FUNNY
MIKE AND HARVEY WERE WORKING TO COBBLE THEM TOGETHER TO MAKE THEM SEEM LIKE THEY WERE ALL WRITTEN BY ONE PERSON
SO WHEN IT COMES TIME FOR AN ELECTION
BUT THE PROBLEM IS NOT GRANDMA'S BENEFITS IT'S THE IDIOTS IN WASHINGTON THAT WON'T FIX IT
THIS IS NOT A BUSINESS WHERE YOU CAN SAY YEAH I'LL RAISE MY PRICES TO WHATEVER WE WANT IT TO BE AND I'LL KEEP THE BUSINESS IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY
THAT'S PART OF THE COST BASE
SIBERIAN YUPIK WAYS OF SUBSISTENCE HUNTING AND OLD SONGS AND STORIES HAVE BEEN PASSED DOWN IN HER FAMILY FOR A LONG TIME
YOU KNOW
AND THIS LADY CAME DOWN AND SAT NEXT TO ME
SYSTEMATICALLY
THOUSANDS HAVE SOUGHT TREATMENT
WE NEED BOTH I MEAN SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO LEAN INTO A SITUATION AND BRING YOURSELF FORWARD AND EXPRESS YOURSELF AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
I MEAN THAT'S FINE IT'S FINE FOR SOMEONE TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO HOOSIERS IF THAT SOMEONE IS WOODY FROM CHEERS OR BOBBY KNIGHT OR LESLIE KNOPE BASICALLY
BUT MEDICARE SPENDING IS NOT GOING UP IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS SIGNIFICANTLY AS A PROPORTION OF GDP
WAS IT JUST FOR FUN
SO THIS CAN LEAD TO A DIAGNOSIS OF A PSYCHOSIS WHEN THERE ISN'T A PSYCHOSIS
OTHER ROBOTS FOLLOWED
AND THE FIRST TOWN TO BE ELECTRIFIED WAS TAMWORTH
YOU KNOW FOOD MAGAZINES AT THE CANDY EMPIRE WERE THE BIG ONES WERE BON APPETIT AND GOURMET AND THEN GOURMET JUST GOT STOMPED OUT SORT OF FOR NO REASON AND LIKE LEFT A BUNCH OF PEOPLE HEARTBROKEN
WHY DO WE THINK MEDICARE IS GOING TO GO OFF THE RAILS
TRAVELLING DOOR-TO-DOOR SALESMEN AND ELECTRICIANS AND CULTURAL SPECTACLES LUNAR PARK THE PICTURE PALACES AND CINEMA
AND THE THINGS THAT MAKE THEM SICK AND DIE SOONER ARE FAR MORE THAN CIGARETTES CHOLESTEROL AND BLOOD PRESSURE
PEOPLE HAVE A FIFTY PERCENT BETTER CHANCE OF RECOVERY THAN THOSE IN EUROPE THE UNITED STATES AND AUSTRALIA
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT WOULD CONFIRM A LOT OF WHAT PEOPLE WERE ALREADY HAVING SUSPICIONS ABOUT AND CLEARLY THAT'S GOING TO ADD FUEL TO ALL THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES FLOATING AROUND IT MAKES AN ALREADY DISORIENTING ERA EVEN MORE DISORIENTING
BUT I THINK EVEN MORE THAN THAT WHAT SHE'S REALLY DONE IS CREATE A WHOLE COMMUNITY OF QUESTIONERS AND SEARCHERS
AND THEN FINALLY
THE REPRESENTATION IN THESE MORE POSTERIOR AREAS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE SEEING YOU ARE ENCODING THE VALUES OF THE FEATURES OF THAT FACE
IT'S FASCINATED SCIENTISTS FOR CENTURIES AND THE WAY WE CONCEPTUALISE IT HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY
EVENTUALLY LEFT THE COMPANY
I'LL FALL IN LOVE WITH HER
SO WHAT IS TO BE DONE
AS THE BOOK OPENS SHE LEARNS THAT HER HUSBAND WILLIAM HAS BEEN CONDUCTING AN AFFAIR
BUT ABOUT FORTY PERCENT IS DUE TO LACK OF INTENSIFICATION OF TREATMENT BY THE PRIMARY CARE SYSTEM
THE BASIC FACT IS THAT THE FIRST BABY BOOMER STATISTICALLY RETIRED ON JANUARY ONE OF THIS YEAR
EVERYONE KNOWS NOW THAT HE'S NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO GET THE NOMINATION
WHAT WOULD CHANGE
FANCY STUFF
SO I AM INTERESTED IN DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO CREATE GAP SPACE
AND THE FIRST STEP IS TO ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THEM AND TO ASK OK
OR THE ONES WE ALREADY MADE

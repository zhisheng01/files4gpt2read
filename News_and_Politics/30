HAD A SURVIVAL COMPARABLE TO SOMEONE WHO WAS FOURTEEN YEARS YOUNGER IN AGE
THEN A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS LATER SAM AND HIS MOTHER ARE IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN SEATTLE
AND SOME STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT THEY'RE NOT THAT WELL REMEMBERED AND OTHER STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT THEY ARE REMEMBERED BETTER THAN ORDINARY MEMORIES BUT NOT AS WELL AS WE THINK
BUT TO WALK THROUGH THE WORLD OPEN TO BEING SURPRISED AND OPEN TO BEING SURPRISED BY
AN ELECTRICAL GRID THAT WASTES TOO MUCH ENERGY AND IS HIGHLY INEFFICIENT
TO START NEW MEDS
STILL GUESSING WHICH WALNUT SHELL CONTAINS THE PEA STILL PRAYING ALONG WITH ELMER GANTRY
AND HAS THE GENOME CHANGED HAVE THE GENES CHANGED
EVERY SINGLE BEACH WILL HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE CDC GUIDELINES
A GOOD WAY TO GET A SENSE OF HER SENSIBILITY IS WATCHING ONE OF HER EARLIEST SHORT FILMS
DO YOU THINK THAT SHE WOULD HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS
WELL THEN I THINK THAT'S A VARIATION ON THE AGE-OLD UNIVERSAL SPIRITUAL PRINCIPLE OF HAVING A SKULL ON YOUR DESK IN OTHER WORDS REALIZING TIME IS LIMITED
THAT'S HOW YOU ARE
THAT THERE IS SOMETHING VERY MAGICAL FOR INSTANCE ABOUT SMALL TOWN AMERICA AND MORE SO THAN NOT THERE'S SOMETHING SUPER POWERFUL ABOUT TEENAGE GIRLS SO THAT'S ALSO WHY
IT'S EASY TO GET HUNG UP ON FINDING A SPECIFIC KIND OF JOB
IF HE HAS ANY SOLUTIONS FOR THIS THAT ARE POLITICALLY VIABLE NOW
SO IT'S A SCAFFOLDING THAT YOU CAN ATTACH YOUR DREAMS YOUR DESIRES YOUR VISION FOR THE FUTURE TO IT
AND SO THAT'S KIND OF WHERE I TRIED TO TAKE THIS PIECE THE IDEA THAT IT'S NOT ABOUT THIS STORY ABOUT THE BOUNTIES WHICH IS TERRIBLE AND IN NO WAY SOMETHING THAT IS DEFENDABLE IS ABSOLUTELY A TOOL THAT I'M SURE THAT RUSSIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE UNITS USE
THERE ARE ALSO ANCIENT METAPHORS THAT CONTINUE TO BE USED LIKE THE WAX TABLET THAT YOU SCRATCH
WASHINGTON EVENTUALLY MANAGED TO UNITE THE STATES UNDER ONE BANNER THIS IS A VERY PARANOID WAY TO START A COUNTRY ISN'T IT ISN'T IT INCREDIBLE HOW MANY CONSPIRACY THEORIES WERE AT PLAY IN AMERICAN POLITICS RIGHT FROM THE START YEAH I MEAN IF YOU GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT HELPED START IT ALL
THE BOSTON MASSACRE
YOU'LL BE CONVINCED THAT CONSPIRACY THEORIES HAVE NOT ONLY BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN SHAPING AMERICAN POLITICS AND CULTURE
STAY TUNED ALSO AS ALWAYS MAKE SURE TO SEND ME THE BEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO YOU THIS WEEK FOR ANY WEEK OR ALL THE WEEKS
YOUR RELATIONSHIP IS A POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR YOUR COMPANY
UNACCEPTABLE SOME OF THE CHAPTERS WERE MUCH TOO GOOD AND I HAD TO WORK LIKE HELL TO MAKE THEM BAD ENOUGH TO USE
WHAT DO YOU SAY
AND WHY WE HEAR A LOT OF ALARMIST TALK ABOUT THE AGING OF THE POPULATION TRUE
I THINK ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS THAT JULIA SAID WHEN WE FIRST MET WAS THAT WHEN SHE FIRST STARTED OUT DOING HER RESEARCH SHE WANTED TO INCLUDE FAMILIES
UNFORTUNATELY
AND IT FEELS LIKE YOU WORK AND YOU WORK AND YOU SEND AN APPLICATION AFTER APPLICATION
CALM MY HANDS AREN'T CLENCHED INTO A FIST IN ANY WAY
AND THERE WERE OCCASIONS WHERE HE WOULD SHOW ALREADY HIS PENCHANT FOR GETTING INVOLVED IN THINGS JUST TO DISCIPLINE PEOPLE
BUT IS IT AN AUTHENTIC MEMORY
IT'S PRIVATE AND PAINFUL AND THEY'RE STILL FIGURING OUT WHAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP CAN BE GOING FORWARD RENE SAYS SHE'S MORE STABLE NOW SHE HAS A JOB SHE REALLY LIKES TEACHING AGAIN
LESS HUMANE WERE SOME EXPERIMENTS DONE ON THE DECAPITATED HEADS
YES
IS POLITICAL LEADERSHIP
ALL RIGHT FAIR WARNING
AND HE TOLD HER DURING ONE OF THESE SESSIONS THAT NOT ONLY WOULD SHE GO BACK TO AN EARLIER PHASE OF THIS LIFE BUT SHE WOULD GO EVEN FURTHER BACK HE DIDN'T SAY HOW FAR BACK
THIS IS AN EXCESSIVE RECOMMENDATION WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT THEY DO
AND SO WE ALSO KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE PROSOPAGNOSIA DON'T TEND TO LOOK AT A FACE AS A WHOLE AS MUCH THEY TEND TO SEE THE PARTS MORE OFTEN
AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SKEPTICISM AND SUSPICION ABOUT THIS INTERVIEW AND WHAT BARR WAS SAYING
BRAD DUCHAINE
WOULD GO ON TO EXPOSE ONE OF THE GREATEST REAL CONSPIRACIES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
THE CHANCES OF AN ADULT PATIENT HAVING A SON OR A DAUGHTER WHO IS IN OUR AGE GROUP IS AROUND ONE IN THREE ONE IN FOUR
AS DIFFICULT AS IT MAY BE
OR IS JUST REALLY SURPRISING THAT SOMEBODY LIKE YOU LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
MARGARET WILL IT
OH YEAH REALLY
AND THEN WHEN HE TURNED AROUND I SAW THERE WERE TEARS IN HIS EYES
RESEARCH BY ANNA WHITFELD
IT ADDS A FACTOR FOR WASTE OF FOOD
I KNOW I KNOW AND UNFORTUNATELY SAYING WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG WITH YOU IS PROBABLY NOT THE BEST WAY TO GO IF WE'RE HOPING TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR
THIRTY AND UNDERS
SO ON THE ONE HAND SEEING THE FACE AS A WHOLE RATHER THAN ITS PARTS IS PARTICULARLY USEFUL
THE ELDERLY PROGRAMS DO NOT HARM YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY
I NEED THAT IN
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN ME THAT HAD GOTTEN LIT ON FIRE THAT I HAD TO FOLLOW AND THAT TOOK ME AWAY FROM ACADEMIC STUDY AND I ENDED UP COMING TO BOULDER
IT'S USUALLY BECAUSE TO BECOME A POLITICIAN YOU HAVE TO DEFINE YOURSELF AGAINST ANOTHER CANDIDATE SO WHAT YOU DO IS YOU PURPOSEFULLY TAKE ONE SIDE OF A WEDGE ISSUE OFTEN YOUR PARTY DICTATES WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO LAND ON THESE WEDGE ISSUES AND THE WEDGE ISSUES EXIST THAN PARTIES GENERALLY ORGANIZE THEMSELVES AROUND THEM
YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS MAKING KNIVES IN SKIN I WANTED TO MAKE A FEMINIST FILM THAT HAD A MISSING GIRL AT ITS CENTER
YOU FEEL GUILTY YOU FEEL REGRETFUL AND YOU KIND OF FEEL LIKE A PIECE OF SHIT DEPENDING ON HOW BAD YOU ARE
SO THE FIFTH AND FINAL TAKE AWAY IF THINGS DON'T WORK OUT ASK FOR A TRANSFER OR SHIFT IN SCHEDULE
AND ONCE YOU'RE PRETTY SURE YOU HAVE THAT OPENING
THE NEXT STAGE IS KIND OF PERCEIVING THE PARTS OF THE FACE
THE BEST STORY THAT I HAVE ON THIS IS OF COURSE
YOU JUST PUT IN ONE LINE INTO THEIR POLICIES MANDATE IT
YOU ARE HEREBY OFFICIALLY INVITED TO BECOME THE CO-AUTHOR OF A BESTSELLING NOVEL
ONE SECOND
HE HAS PUT A FULL HALT ON ANY COOPERATION WITH THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY
AND IT LOOKS AT HOW AGE-OLD ISSUES ARE TAKING NEW FORMS AND PERHAPS INVITING NEW RESPONSES AS WE TRY TO CHART OUR WAY THROUGH THIS YOUNG CENTURY
AND IT'S RIVETING
SHE SAID WHAT HE IS DOING WHAT HE IS ALLOWING TO DO
IS THE DIFFICULTY TO DO WITH PERCEIVING FACES OR REMEMBERING FACES
ALL OF US
WHICH IS INFAMOUS AND CLASSIC
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE LONGER LINE OF BEHAVIOR OF RUSSIA IN AFGHANISTAN AND SYRIA IN PARTICULAR AGAINST OUR SPECIAL FORCES WHO ARE SORT OF THE TIP OF THE SPEAR OF OUR REAL EFFORTS TO GET AFTER THESE TYPES OF SORT OF DISRUPTIVE HYBRID TACTICS TARGETING THE UNITED STATES
THAT'S WHEN NEW LIFE AND FRESH IDEAS CAN COME THROUGH US AND INTO THE SITUATION I THINK THAT'S A LOT ACTUALLY WHERE HUMOR COMES FROM TOO
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THE POSTAL SERVICE
ON BEING IS TRENT GILLISS CHRIS HEAGLE LILY PERCY
ALL OF A SUDDEN
YEAH THANK YOU
IF SHE'S NOT OK
GO THROUGH THE BOARDS
YES
ALL OF WHICH ARE TRUE BUT YOU CANNOT SEPARATE THE RUSSIAN AND CHINESE TACTICS THEY ARE FROM THE SAME PLAYBOOK
WELL YOU'RE RIGHT
YES
AND OF COURSE AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS
SO YOU'RE USING THE TRADITIONAL METHOD OF STORYTELLING WITHIN ABORIGINAL SOCIETY IN ORDER TO BOTH GET INFORMATION FROM THE PEOPLE AND TO EDUCATE THE PEOPLE ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES
HE WAS FORCIBLY TAKEN TO THAT CORNER
YOU KNOW
HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISE WAS TO CLEAN UP THE REST OF THE COUNTRY
IT MEANS MAJOR STRAINS ON OUR ALREADY OVERSTRETCHED HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS
LOOK AT THE GARBAGE THAT GETS PRINTED
I HEARD SOME STUFF ABOUT IT IN THE RUNUP TO THE OSCARS LAST WEEK
POLITICIANS WHO WON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER AND WORK WITH EACH OTHER
WAIT
ELIZABETH CHRISTINE TOM MEGAN NICOLE
YES
SENA DOVER AND HER TWENTY FOUR YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER SOPHIE HAVE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP TODAY

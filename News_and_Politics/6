WHETHER IT BE AT HOME OR ABROAD IN THIS ADMINISTRATION THE UNWILLINGNESS TO SIT DOWN AND CONNECT THOSE DOTS IS CRIPPLING US IN TERMS OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF OUR SECURITY AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO
NEW TECHNOLOGIES DO NOT ALWAYS SUPERSEDE THE OLD ONES AND WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME NEGOTIATING AND NAVIGATING BETWEEN NEW AND OLD

YOU CAN DEFINITELY SEE ALL MY STITCHES ALL THE WAY AROUND
YOU DO THAT BY COVERING UP YOUR LENS AND THEN BEING IN A NEW LOCATION
YES HOLD ON HOLD ON
AND IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN ONE STEP WHICH IT PROBABLY WON'T
LUNA IS TELLING ME I'M DOING A GOOD JOB
WE'VE BEEN DOIN' THIS FOR A WHILE NOW
YOU'RE AN ARTIST WITHOUT A WEBSITE
EXHALE THROUGH EXTENDED CHILD'S POSE
ACTUALLY
BUT I'M NOT LOOKING FOR THEM TO BE THAT WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR THEM TO BE IS RELIABLE
REALLY LISTEN TO NICE AUDIBLE BREATH
OPENING UP INTO THIS MAGIC MOMENT THIS TWIST HERE
THEN YOU CAN START TO STRAIGHTEN THE LEGS AGAIN FIND STILLNESS AS YOU INHALE LOTS OF LOVE IN
KIND OF POP FROM EACH OTHER
REMEMBERING TO BREATHE DEEP IF YOU'RE HOLDING IN THE NECK OR THE SHOULDER HERE TRY TO SOFTEN
THOSE WOULD BE A FEW THAT COME TO MIND
IF ANY TORN PIECES OF PAPER REMAIN INSIDE THE TRAY
NO MATTER WHAT CAMERA YOU HAVE AFTER THAT I'M GOING TO BE SHOWING YOU AN EXAMPLE VIDEO THAT HAS FOUR DIFFERENT TYPE OF CAMERAS COMBINED INTO ONE VIDEO
TIE IT AGAIN
IT'S FORCED ME TO IMPROVISE AND I JUST
EXHALE RELEASE
INHALE SQUEEZE THE RIGHT KNEE UP TOWARDS YOUR HEART
IF YOU START PUTTING OTHER THINGS BEHIND YOU LIKE IF YOU HAVE
SO THIS IS LIKE VERY NATURAL IT'S A VERY VERY YOUTHFUL NATURAL ORANGE ALL OF THEM ARE SAYING CANNOT SEE ON CAMERA
WE ARE JUST GOING TO REPEAT
PRACTICE TO SLOW DOWN THE BREATH AND REALLY TO SLOW EVERYTHING DOWN SO YOU'RE GONNA INHALE FOR FOUR
THAT SAYS A LOT
AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE READY INHALE IN AND EXHALE GENTLY PEEL THE NOSE UP TOWARD THE KNEE
ALL RIGHT LET'S DO A SHOW
MEANS YOU'RE EDITING THAT BOX THAT THE VECTOR SITS IN
EXHALE
THE AIR COMPRESSOR IS GEAR-DRIVEN
THEN EXHALE RAIN IT DOWN WE'RE GONNA INTERLACE THE FINGERTIPS AND DRAW THE KNUCKLES DOWN AND THEN AWAY
THANK YOU SO MUCH LUNA
GREAT LIFT YOUR STERNUM TOWARDS YOUR THUMBS ACTIVE IN THE ARMS HERE
SO YOUR BREATH IN AND YOUR BREATH OUT BECOME EVEN AND STEADY
LEVEL AND HARD
VERY VERY HANDY TO HAVE AROUND
IF THE PAGE DOES NOT PRINT
TWO
YOU WANT THAT SPACE
SLOW-LOADING PAGES ARE ANNOYING FOR THE USER EXPERIENCE
HAVE YOU EVER RAN A FACEBOOK AD BEFORE IF SO COMMENT BELOW AND LET ME KNOW WHAT I DID
CHALK PASTELS OR KIDS CHALK
AND ALLOWING THE BREATH TO RETURN BACK TO ITS NATURAL RHYTHM
OH YEAH PUT YOUR RIGHT KNEE DOWN AND STRETCH YOUR ARMS UP
YOU THINK IT'S COMPLEX GREAT
I AM STRONG
BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES
MAKING IT ALL COME TOGETHER
FORTUNATELY THESE THINGS SPELL A WORD
EVERYONE HUG YOUR ELBOWS INTO YOUR SIDE BODY AND ON YOUR INHALE LIFT UP COBRA
SO AT THE BOTTOM OF EACH OF THESE PIECES THE BOTTOM OF FOUR THE BOTTOM OF FIVE AND THE BOTTOM OF SIX
FROM MY HEART TO YOURS
AND I HOPE THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTIONS
CAUSE THIS IS A TOUCHING GIFT
DON'T YOU LIFT YOUR PUBIC BONE UP TOWARDS YOUR NAVEL
SLIGHT BEND IN THAT LEFT KNEE
I DON'T WANT TO RUN OUT OF MEMORY WHILE WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A DEMO
RIGHT HEEL ON THE EARTH OR LIFTED
TOUCH TOOLS
EVEN THINGS LIKE MORTGAGE CALCULATOR
FOLD LINING TOWARD FRONT AND PIN RAW EDGES TOGETHER AT WAIST AND LEG OPENINGS STITCH TOGETHER CLOSE TO WAIST SIDES AND LEG OPENINGS USING A NARROW ZIGZAG STITCH
CAREFUL NOT TO GRIP THE TOES
INHALE TO LIFT UP HALFWAY GO AHEAD AND SLIDE THE PALMS TO THE TOPS OF THE THIGHS FOR THIS FIRST ONE
THAT IS AWESOME
AND USE THIS NEXT BEAT
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NEXT IS TO USE A NEEDLE AND A THREAD TO ATTACH THE TWO ELASTIC A PIECES FROM HERE TO HERE
REACH INTO THE CARTRIDGE ACCESS AREA AND MANUALLY MOVE THE CARRIAGE
AND THAT'S GOING TO APPLY THAT DISTORTION
ABSOLUTELY
IT'S CREATING THE WIDTH OF THE CHANNEL BUT IT'S ALSO SERVING AS A START AND A STOP POINT AS A GUIDE
YOU ARE GOING TO DO THE SLIP STITCH BY HAND SO YOU NEED TO GET SOME MATCHING THREAD AND A HAND NEEDLE
I USED HARD MAPLE FOR THE SOUND BOX NECK AND PILLAR AND BALTIC BIRCH PLYWOOD FOR THE SOUNDBOARD IN THE BACK
SLIDE IN THE INPUT TRAY
AND THAT'S HOW YOU SHOULD EXPECT YOUR PAINT IT IS HOW YOU SHOULD EXPECT YOUR PAINT
UPPER BODY'S IN PLANK LONG NECK
THAT WAY IT'S GOING TO HAVE SOME STRETCH ONCE YOU LET GO YOU DON'T WANT TO PULL A LOT JUST A LITTLE BIT
WHEN YOU'RE READY JUST GETTING USED TO MOVING WITH THE BREATH AND JUST GOING BACK FOR A SECOND STACKING THE BONES IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE
YOU WILL SEE HERE THERE'S A NOTE AND THEY WANT YOU TO CUT OUT ONE NUMBER TEN BUT THEY WANT IT TO BE TWICE THE LENGTH OF THE PATTERN PIECE
UP THE SIDE
WE PLANT THE PALMS CURL THE BACK TOES UNDER
THE PRINTER MUST BE ON FOR THESE STEPS TO WORK
SO EVEN IN THE FOUR HOUR BODY WHEN I ATE WHATEVER IT WAS LIKE SEVEN THOUSAND CALORIES IN TWELVE HOURS
FOR INSTANCE THEY WANTED TO TEST PLATING
AND THEN EXHALE ALL THE WAY BACK DOWN TO YOUR LUNGE STEP THE RIGHT TOES BACK YOU CAN GO STRAIGHT TO DOWNWARD DOG HERE OR CHOOSE A LITTLE VINYASA
NOT EVERYONE NECESSARILY CONSIDERS THIS TO BE A BONUS AS WRINKLE FREE OR WRINKLE RESISTANT FABRICS ARE TYPICALLY TREATED WITH A FORMALDEHYDE SOLUTION WHICH MAY GIVE SOME MEN PAUSE
GET LIGHT ON YOUR FACE AND HIT RECORD
IT'LL BE AT THE VERY END
YOU WANT LAYERS
RELEASE YOUR HANDS FROM YOUR LEGS
THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET IN MARKETING SO WHICHEVER METHOD YOU CHOOSE FIRST YOU STILL NEED TO PUT IN SOME WORK HAVE YOU TRIED ANY OF THESE METHODS
JUST LIKE WE HAVE DONE BEFORE
AND MAKE LITTLE STREAKS COMING DOWN
IT JUST SO HAPPENED THAT WAY
THE FOLKS FROM ISLAND CABINET ARE WORKING TIRELESSLY ON THE KITCHEN MAKEOVER USING KITCHEN CABINETS PROVIDED BY OUR FRIENDS AT CHOICE CABINETS
READY GIDDY-UP WE'RE GONNA SHIFT IT FORWARD NICE AND SLOW SO SLOW IT DOWN
SO THE FIRST ONE I AM JUST GOING TO THREAD LIKE NORMAL
NICOLE I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP OVER HERE AT THE CAMERA
NOW SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE WHERE YOU'LL SEE THE TOP TEN RANKING PAGES THE MAIN COLUMN YOU WANT TO LOOK AT HERE IS KEYWORDS

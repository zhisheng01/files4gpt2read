LET'S GO THROUGH A FEW IMPORTANT ONES YOU SHOULD FIX
EXHALE TO RELEASE
ON AN EXHALE HOP JUMP FLOAT TO THE TOP
THEN JUST ATTACH ANY CLOSURES AND THERE YOU HAVE YOUR SWEATER
WARRIOR ONE SO IT SOUNDS GREAT
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THEM
IF ANY TORN PIECES OF PAPER REMAIN INSIDE THE PRINTER
I WAS GOING TO DO THIS BECAUSE I'M SO USED TO IT
ALMOST IT'S NOT BURNT ORANGE BUT IT'S A VERY DARK ORANGE AND I'M GOING TO START THE FEET OFF WITH THIS ORANGE
THE RULE OF THREE IS SO STRONG THAT THE AUDIENCE HAS COME TO RECOGNIZE IT TO THE DEGREE THAT THEY EVEN BEGIN TO CLAP AS SOON AS LOUIS HITS HIS THIRD AND MOST SPECIFIC ELABORATION ON THE PUNCHLINE
SEVEN DEADLY SINS OF SPEAKING THESE ARE THINGS I THINK WE NEED TO AVOID
YOU ARE SUPPORTED
AIR TANKS AIR GAUGES APPLICATION PRESSURE GAUGES
BUT FROM THE NOTCH UPTO THE SIDE SEAM IT SHOULD LIE FLAT
SO IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE HIGH-END HARDWARE BUT IF YOU'RE USING YOUR VISES A LOT
THIS IS LIKE A LITTLE ORIENTATION VIDEO BUT THIS YEAR IN LIGHT OF OUR THEME
OKAY YOU CAN KEEP THE FEET ACTIVE BUT YOU CAN LET GO OF THE PELVIS TILT HOPEFULLY YOU FOUND A LITTLE CONNECTION TO YOUR ABDOMINAL WALL THERE
AND THEN I BROUGHT IT THROUGH TO THE INSIDE AGAIN TIED A COUPLE OF KNOTS IN THE THREAD
NOTICE IF YOU'RE COLLAPSING THE SHOULDER BLADES HERE
AWESOME FROM HERE I'M GOING TO CURL THE TOES UNDER
AGAIN THANK YOU GUYS
GREAT GO AHEAD AND LOWER THE BACK KNEE
IF WE MOVE UP HERE TO TRANSFORM OBJECT
NICE LOW LUNGE AS YOU INHALE
TURN TO THE BACK
THIS ICON LOOKS LIKE A SMALL WRENCH
THEN YOU SEAR IT AND COOK IT AND WHATNOT
AEROPRESS
WE'RE HERE FOR ONE I LOVE YOU
DON'T WORRY JUST HAVE FAITH THAT IT WILL COME TOGETHER START BY REVIEWING ALL THE FOOTAGE AND CHOOSING YOUR FAVORITES FROM EACH CLIP
SO WHAT DO WE HAVE
THIS IS IMPORTANT
A COTTON SHAWL COLLAR CABLE CARDIGAN LAMB'S WOOL FAIR ISLE SWEATERS
YOU MIGHT BEGIN TO SHIMMY YOUR SHOULDERS TO DROP THE LEFT SHOULDER DOWN
MOVING WITH THE BREATH
YOU CAN CUT THEM TO FIT TOO
YOU KNOW UNLESS YOU WERE SUPER RED SENSITIVE IN YOUR EYES
AND IT ALLOWED ME TO PROGRESS MUCH MUCH FASTER
MAYBE IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE DOMING THROUGH THE UPPER BACK BODY
AND IF YOU SEE DOWN HERE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE
IN MY OWN PRACTICE AND WITH MY WORK
I'M GOING TO PUT A LITTLE MARK AND I'M GOING TO DO ANOTHER LITTLE ARC AND THAT
TRIM END
I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE FOUR REALLY POWERFUL CORNERSTONES FOUNDATIONS
OKAY HALLELUJAH CHILD
TOUCH THE SETTINGS ICON
SEE IF YOU CAN KEEP IT STILL IN LINE WITH YOUR RIGHT KNEE
FOUR
WATCH HOW OFTEN LOUIS LOVES TO REPEAT THESE PUNCH LINES WHEN JOKES ARE JUST KILLING IT TYPICALLY HE DOES IT IN GROUPS OF THREE
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE IN A CIRCLE HERE SO THE GOAL TODAY IS TO NOT DO IT PERFECT BUT TO JUST
BRUSHSTROKE SEE THAT
EXHALE TO SOFTEN AND BOW FOLLOW YOUR BREATH
SEE IF YOU CAN DRAW YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER IN LINE WITH YOUR LEFT AS YOU PLAY HERE ROTATING THE ANKLE
BUT JUST KNOW IT'S NOT YOU
I'M GOING TO GET THIS CAN YOU ERASE IT AND NOT HAVE A PROBLEM
MAYBE ACTUALLY HIS FINGERS
OH AND A SHADOW UNDER A FOOT
HOLD ON HOLD THAT THOUGHT
INHALE
AND BE SURE THAT YOU HAVE YOUR YOGA STRAP HANDY
HERE'S YOUR FINAL LINK BUILDING CHECKLIST YOU SHOULD GO THROUGH
DON'T START ON THE COMPLETE EDGE MOVING FORWARD
OKAY WAIT NO WE'VE DONE THAT HAVEN'T WE
SO AS YOU CAN NOTICE RIGHT NOW IIVE BEEN TALKING TO THE CAMERA LENS NOT JUST THE CAMERA
MOVING IN A BIG CIRCLE EXHALE AROUND AND BACK AND THEN REVERSE YOUR CIRCLE AGAIN INHALING AS YOU COME FORWARD
FIND THAT LENGTH THAT SPACE BETWEEN THE EAR LOBES AND THE SHOULDERS
USE OTHER PARTS AS SUBTOPICS AND DO YOUR BEST TO COVER THE TOPIC USING DATA
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS FOLD ONE AND FOUR IN HALF
ARE YOU PAINTING THIS FROG WITH US
WE RELEASE INTO SAVASANA
AND NOW WITH THE BREATH INHALING LIFTING THE LEFT ARM REACHING IT UP AND OUT
I'M SURE THAT'S JUST HIS SHOW'S NAME
AND IT'S FOR THE PURPOSES OF GETTING A VEHICLE OFF THE ROAD ONTO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
IF THE PAGE PRINTS SUCCESSFULLY THE ISSUE IS RESOLVED
LET IT GO OUT THROUGH YOUR NOSE
IT REALLY IS A HEARTFELT WELCOME FROM MY HOME TO YOURS BUT ALSO
THIS SCARES ME A LITTLE BIT
THEN YOU SEE THAT LITTLE VEGETABLE PEELER
SQUEEZE THOSE ELBOWS IN
RETURN TO THE FRONT
OK JUST YEAH THAT'S GOOD
FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THE THINGS THE LINKEDIN APP HAS ACCESS TO
OR YOU CAN SELECT AN APP OR SITE WHERE YOU WANT TO RE-ACTIVATE THEIR ACCESS TO YOUR FACEBOOK DATA
ON BEHALF OF DESIGNING SPACES
UNDERWATER YOGA
THAT'S A FUNDRAISER FOR DIGHTON
AWESOME IF YOU'RE IN CHILD'S POSE MAKE YOUR WAY TO DOWN DOG
AND THEN OUT
INHALE IN
SITEMAPS TELL SEARCH ENGINES WHERE TO FIND IMPORTANT CONTENT ON YOUR SITE SO THEY CAN EASILY CRAWL AND INDEX YOUR PAGES
YOU CAN FORMALLY REMOVE THEIR PERMISSIONS BY TAPPING THE CIRCLE TO THE LEFT OF ANY APPS TO DISPLAY A BLUE CHECKMARK
INHALE COW POSE PRESS INTO ALL TEN KNUCKLES PRESS INTO THE TOPS OF THE FEET
MORE PAPER JAMS ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR
REMOVE THE PAPER FROM THE INPUT TRAY
THE WAY THIS WORKS AND THE REASON IT WORKS
RELAX YOUR JAW
AND
TO CLOSE YOUR EYES AND ONCE AGAIN DEEPEN YOUR BREATH
ALSO SKIP THE NYLON AND SKIP THE COLOR BLACK AS EVERYBODY HAS A BLACK OVERCOAT IT'S A LIFELESS COLOR AND IT'S ULTIMATELY KIND OF BORING
SLOWLY BRING THE LEFT HAND TO YOUR HEART CENTER

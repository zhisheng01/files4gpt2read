3701.AND FEELING SO EXPOSED AND SELF CONSCIOUS
3702.SO
3703.IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE AND IT'S NOT GOING TO STOP BECAUSE ALL WE'RE DOING IS HIDING IT
3704.AND IT'S JUST GOING OVER MY HEAD
3705.HE WROTE ABOUT HOROLOGY CONSULTED ON HOROLOGY BOOKS
3706.LOOKED ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYES AND TOLD ME THAT I CAN BE THE SHOW STEALER IF I WANTED TO AND THAT SHE KNOWS I CAN
3707.WHAT IF ANYTHING WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO SOMEONE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
3708.I CAN THINK OF A TRAIL BY MY HOUSE
3709.YOU KNOW PREDATORS AND VICTIMS IDENTIFY WITH EACH OTHER BECAUSE IT'S A CYCLE
3710.UM I GUESS I ENJOYED MEETING NEW PEOPLE AND BEING ABLE TO TELL MY STORY AGAIN AND AGAIN AND ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I LEARNED ABOUT THERAPY IS IT IS REPETITION
3711.AT FIRST SHE WAS OK WITH IT UNTIL SHE SAW THAT MY FRIENDS WERE ALL WHITE
3712.OF COURSE NOT I'M LIKE
3713.AND MY MOTHER HAD A BOYFRIEND AT THE TIME
3714.UNTIL THAT PANIC GOES AWAY
3715.I CAN THINK ABOUT WORK THE WHOLE TIME BUT IT
3716.IT'S LIKE MAN NOW YOU NEED SOME INGENUITY
3717.YES AND ALSO LIKE
3718.NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT
3719.AND THEN THERE'S ME
3720.I PULLED OUT AND I SCRATCHED A CAR AND I KNOW IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS IN THAT FOG
3721.I THINK I STILL
3722.I SAID IT'S
3723.STARTING A BUSINESS
3724.I SUBSTITUTE LOVE AND
3725.BUT THEY ARE REALLY TEARS OF HEALING YOUR SOUL AND HEALING THAT
3726.BUT SHE WROTE
3727.E AND I WENT OUT TO THE YARD TO TALK TO SOME THREE-STRIKERS ABOUT THEIR SENTENCES MY NAME IS STACY BULLOCK
3728.THAT LITTLE WORD MEANT SO MUCH TO ME
3729.JUST
3730.THAT HE WAS A GREAT COACH AND THAT HE WOULD EVENTUALLY ASSEMBLE A GREAT TEAM IN
3731.AND UM
3732.I SAID LET'S PLAY SOME HOCKEY
3733.YOU KNOW
3734.AND EACH OF THOSE NAMES IS A MYSTERY TO ME
3735.HE INCLUDES THE WORDS MAYBE I KNEW TOO MUCH
3736.THINGS THAT
3737.LATER IN LIFE UM
3738.I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS AT MY LOWEST
3739.ON A DAILY BASIS
3740.BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE DRINKING
3741.IS SEEKING HELP
3742.AND ONCE I WAS ABLE TO SEE THAT I HAD BROUGHT SOMETHING TO THE TABLE THAT WAS LESS THAN IDEAL
3743.AND THEN I WOULD GET STUCK I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I WOULD THINK MOVE
3744.HOW YOU DOING WITH YOUR HIGHER POWER AND I'M LIKE
3745.UNDER PROP SIXTY SIX YOUR SENTENCE MIGHT BE DRAMATICALLY REDUCED YEAH IT WAS GONNA BE A HUGE CHANGE
3746.UM TO ME OBVIOUSLY THE MEAT OF IT WHICH JUST PROVED WE ARE NOT ALONE AND WHAT I FOUND SO MOVING WAS THE HUGS TALK ABOUT THE HUGS THEO
3747.CONTINUING

3753.I'M THINKING THE ONLY WAY I CAN GET THROUGH THE DAY IS TO CONTACT A PROSTITUTE TO SEE TONIGHT TO FORCE MY BRAIN TO THINK OF ANOTHER WOMAN WHY DOES LIFE HAVE TO BE THIS WAY FOR ANYONE
3754.WHEN YOU'VE BEEN OVER THERE HAVE YOU'VE BEEN POKING AROUND FOR THE FOR THE BURIED TREASURE
3755.YOU KNOW NOT IN A NAVEL-GAZING WAY BUT IN A
3756.I CALLED MY GRANDMA AND INCOHERENTLY BLUBBERED TO HER ASKING HER TO COME OVER
3757.THE NIGHT AFTER I REALIZED I WAS TRANS I STARTED DRINKING AND TAKING XANAX TWO AT A TIME I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY I TOOK
3758.HE WORKED AT THE SCHOOL

3760.BUT I HAD A WEIRD ON AND OFF CRUSH ON HER THAT MADE THINGS WEIRD IN THE END
3761.HE'S A CLOCK RESTORER LIKE JOHN WAS
3762.I WAS THREE YEARS OLD AT THE TIME AND IT'S THE FIRST MEMORY THAT I CAN REMEMBER FROM CHILDHOOD

3770.UM
3771.THROUGH LIVE TEXTING
3772.THIS CONTINUED UNTIL ONE NIGHT WHEN I DECIDED TO PRETEND TO SLEEP
3773.THAT IS WHAT OUR BRAIN DOES
3774.IF YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT IT'S NOT GONNA GO AWAY
3775.AND ABOUT HAVING DISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY DISORDER IT'S LIKE RUNNING THE WORLD'S LONGEST RELAY RACE WITH A GROUP OF DYSFUNCTIONAL PEOPLE WHO HAVE TROUBLE GETTING ALONG

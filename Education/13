GIVING THE OPTION FOR ALL ONLINE LEARNING MIGHT BE A PERFECT FOR SOME BUT IS HARDLY ADEQUATE FOR MANY
AND THEN AS OTHER DIAGNOSIS
A TEAM OF ENGINEERS AND BIOLOGISTS DEVELOP A WORKING WORM COMPUTER MEMORY OUT OF SALMON DNA MOLECULES BY COMBINING THE DNA WITH SILVER NANOPARTICLES
I MEAN YOU JUST DON'T GET A BADGE THEY DON'T SAY THEY DON'T FOLLOW UP AND SAY
COMMENT FROM GREG
ONLY A LITTLE OVER HALF OF RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATES IN THE UNITED STATES WHO GET A HIGHER EDUCATION ACTUALLY ARE WORKING IN JOBS THAT REQUIRE THAT EDUCATION
PLEASE PLEASE FOR THOSE
THEY DON'T HAVE TO IT SHOULD BE A CHOICE
NASA'S CASSINI SPACECRAFT DETECTS OXYGEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF SATURN'S MOON DIONE
SCIENCE BASED PRACTICES TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS IT COULD BE A HYBRID IN PERSON AND REMOTE LEARNING MASK WEARING SOCIAL DISTANCING
THEN INSERT AN EXTRA AND
DOES THAT HAVE ANY NEANDERTHAL CONTRIBUTION OR NOT
OKAY MINE IS FROM ARRIANA PADRON
FURTHERMORE I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS ILLNESS AND THAT DECISIONS AFFECTING BROAD GROUPS OF PEOPLE OF VARYING AGES AND HEALTH CONDITIONS SHOULD BE MADE CAUTIOUSLY AND WITHOUT INTERNAL BIAS
EDUCATION TO THE WHOLE WORLD
WHEN WE SAW IN THE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATIONS ONLINE
YES AND THAT'S THE LAST ONE
META-ANALYSIS OF FORTY TWO PREVIOUS STUDIES CONCLUDES THAT SOME CONSUMPTION OF CHOCOLATE MAY BE GOOD FOR THE HEART
AND A LENGTH
I WOULD REQUEST THAT THIRTEEN B WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THIRTEEN B
A DRUG MADE FROM A PLANT KNOWN AS THUNDER GOD VINE
AMERICAN RESEARCHERS REPORT THAT THEIR EXPERIMENTS WITH LIQUID CRYSTALS MAY YIELD FUTURE MATERIALS THAT CAN BE DIRECTLY CONTROLLED AND RE-SHAPED IN REAL TIME
THE NEW MATERIAL COULD ENABLE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL TREES THAT LOWER ATMOSPHERIC CONCENTRATIONS OF C O TWO IN AN EFFORT TO LESSEN THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
SO MENTAL HEALTH NURSES
AND EVERYBODY'S USING THAT AND IT
THE TELEPORTATION METHOD WHICH UTILISES QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT TO TRANSFER INFORMATION BETWEEN POINTS WITHOUT CROSSING THE INTERVENING SPACE COULD ALLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF ULTRA-SECURE SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS
A FIFTEEN YEAR RESEARCH PROJECT HAS SUCCEEDED IN CURBING THE GROWTH OF POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE ONE OF THE MOST COMMON LIFE-THREATENING GENETIC DISEASES WHICH AFFECTS TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE
ELEVATED C O TWO LEVELS ON HUMANS CAUSE DECREASED COGNITIVE ABILITY STARTING AT SIX HUNDRED PPM
PROFESSOR PAABO WRITES THAT WHEN HE GOT TO THE LAB MATTIAS AND A YOUNG ARCHEOLOGIST
THAT BE GOOD YEAH
FOR OUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WE BELIEVE THAT LOCAL CONDITIONS SUPPORT THIS APPROACH
BUT IT WOULD BE A DAY
J LETT
IS CAN I A POINT OF ORDER I'M SORRY
TRUSTEE BARTO
SO IT'S THIS IDEA HERE
MY TURN
EVEN IF LEVEL THREE IS SELECTED IT IS A SLEDGEHAMMER
AT LEAST ONE POINT SIX PLANETS
DISTANT LEARNING SOCIAL DISTANCING AND REQUIRED MASK IS NOT PROVIDING THEM WITH THIS ENVIRONMENT
PERFECT
AND WE WERE FOCUSING MORE ON THE FORTY PERCENT MODEL FIFTY PERCENT MODEL
SO MY OPTION WAS TO ADD A PARENT CHOICE FOR THIS WEDNESDAY TIME TO ASK
AND WE HAVE KIDS DOING VARIOUS ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE CAMPUS IN OUTDOOR SPACE
PHYSICISTS HAVE SHOWN THAT SYNTHETIC MEMBRANE CHANNELS CAN BE CONSTRUCTED THROUGH DNA NANOTECHNOLOGY
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT OUR STUDENTS RECEIVE THE HIGHEST QUALITY MOST RIGOROUS AND EQUITABLE EDUCATION POSSIBLE
PHYSICISTS CONDUCT THE FIRST QUANTUM TELEPORTATION FROM ONE MACROSCOPIC OBJECT TO ANOTHER POTENTIALLY ALLOWING THE DEVELOPMENT OF QUANTUM ROUTERS AND A QUANTUM INTERNET
AS FOR THE OTHER OPTIONS I HAVE GREAT CONCERNS OPTION ONE WILL NEVER HAPPEN THIS SCHOOL YEAR AS OF TODAY CALIFORNIA IS BACKSLIDING IN OUR CONTROL OF THE VIRUS AND MORE CLOSURES AND STATE RESTRICTIONS ARE ISSUED DAILY
AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO EFFECTIVELY MOVE CS AND THEN JUMP SOMEWHERE UP INTO THE SERVICE RUNTIME
BUT IF THIS IS NOT A NEANDERTHAL THEN THEY DON'T EXIST SO TO SAY
OKAY GREAT THANK YOU
THAT IT WOULD REDUCE CLASS SIZES WITH SOME SOCIAL DISTANCING
I'VE KNOWN FRED FOR A LONG TIME
IF WE HAD ADEQUATE FUNDING EQUIPMENT AND TRAINED STAFF TO ENSURE SOCIAL DISTANCING AND OTHER GUIDELINES WERE MET TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF VIRAL TRANSFER THEN WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONSIDER REOPENING OUR CAMPUSES FOR IN PERSON TEACHING
THE CALLER WAS MATTHIAS KRINGS A GRADUATE STUDENT IN MY LABORATORY AT THE ZOOLOGICAL INSTITUTE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MUNICH
WE ARE ALSO GRATEFUL FOR THE TEAM THAT YOU HAVE ASSEMBLED THAT IS LEAVING US IN A POSITION TO BE CONTINUED TO BE STABLE
IS THEIR SICK LEAVE COVER PAID
YES THANK YOU
NANOTECH
DUE TO THE IMMEDIATE CLOSURE OF THE SCHOOLS THIS PAST SPRING THE TEACHERS HAD TO RELY ON COMPUTER BASED LEARNING ENTIRELY WHICH LED TO UPWARD OF SIX PLUS HOURS A DAY ON SCREENS FOR OUR CHILDREN
ARE THE RESULTS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC
SO WE'RE GONNA BE FOCUSING ON AGAIN REOPENING TODAY
NOR WOULD TEACHERS PARENTS WANT RANDOM SUBSTITUTES IN THE CLASSROOMS WITH THEIR CHILDREN
NANOTECHNOL
THERE WAS DIFFICULTY IN OUR ABILITY AS PARENTS TO TEACH MATH IN THE MODELS THAT ARE CURRENTLY TAUGHT IN AS OPPOSED TO HOW WE ARE TAUGHT FOR EXAMPLE
SO THIS IS THE REASON WHY I THINK THEY DON'T WANT THE SPRINGBOARD TO COME FROM THE DEVELOPER
USING THIS METHOD A DEVICE WHICH READS AND TRANSMITS THE THOUGHTS OF BRAIN-DAMAGED PATIENTS COULD BECOME A REALITY IN THE FUTURE
OR IF THEY HAVE A ZERO PERIOD WILL THEY GET THE EARLY SESSION
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO ACCEPT A K TWO ASSIGNMENT WITHIN A CLASSROOM
MAY I HAVE A MOTION PLEASE
NOT TO MENTION THE ANXIETY OF HAVING TO STAY AWAY FROM YOUR FRIENDS
AND I THINK THAT CONSISTENCY IS SOMETHING THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT FACTOR WHEN PEOPLE MAKE THEIR DECISIONS AS TO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO
THEY NEED LEADERS WHO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS AND COMMUNICATE OPENLY
I WANT US TO JUST IT'S FOR STUDENT OUTSIDE SEATING AREAS AT ENSIGN
THERE'S A PAUSE
ACCORDING TO GENETIC STUDIES MODERN HUMANS SEEM TO HAVE MATED WITH AT LEAST TWO GROUPS OF ANCIENT HUMANS NEANDERTHALS AND DENISOVANS
WILL SCHOOLS BE SUPPLIED PLEXIGLASS DESKS AND AIR PURIFIERS FILTERS AND FOR EACH CLASSROOM
SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE
PARTICULARLY IN THIS CONTEXT
OPTIONS TWO AND THREE ARE JUST DELAYING THE INEVITABLE OF ALL STUDENTS ENDING UP IN ONLINE LEARNING SETTINGS AND IS ALSO A WASTE OF TIME AND RESOURCES
SO IF YOU CHOSE AFTERNOONS
WHY NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR FABULOUS WEATHER BY CREATING OUTDOOR CLASSROOMS THAT ALLOW FOR GREATER SOCIAL DISTANCING WHILE INCREASING CLASS SIZE FLEXIBILITY
CAN THE DISTRICT LOOK INTO STREAMING CLASSES
THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION HERE THAT I WANT YOU TO BE AWARE OF
TRUSTEE
I AM MOST CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF EDUCATION MY CHILDREN HAVE RECEIVED THESE PAST FEW MONTHS
THIS PERSON IS THE EXPERT
PARENTS TEACHERS AND STAFF TO HAVE THAT CHOICE
WAS THIS HANDLING OF QUESTIONS
THEN YOU MUST NOT RISK THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY
SO IF YOU GO BACK TO THE COMMON ANCESTOR WITH THE CHIMP A BIT OVER ONE PERCENT LESS SUBSTITUTIONS THAN YOU WOULD EXPECT
THEY DESERVE CONSISTENCY
MEDICAL SCIENTISTS REPORT ON THE BASIS OF A DECADE-LONG DOUBLE-BLIND STUDY INVOLVING NEARLY FIFTEEN THOUSAND OLDER MALE PHYSICIANS THAT SUBJECTS TAKING A DAILY MULTIVITAMIN WERE ASSOCIATED WITH EIGHT PERCENT FEWER CANCERS COMPARED TO SUBJECTS TAKING A PLACEBO
AGAIN THESE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS COME AFTER WE KNOW WHAT OBJECTIVE HEALTH MEASURES WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE IF IT IS SAFE TO RETURN
SO I KNOW A LOT OF QUESTIONS WOULD PROBABLY SURFACE AS FAR AS WHAT SOME OF THE EXTENDED LEARNING ACTIVITIES WOULD BE
I THINK YOU'RE NEXT RIGHT
SO THEY BASICALLY ENFORCE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SEMANTICS THAN WHAT X EIGHT SIX ENFORCES IN TERMS OF WHAT AN INSTRUCTION IS
WHICH WAS SAILING NEAR THE CENTER OF THE HURRICANE
THE PRINTING OF THREE D TISSUE HAS TAKEN A MAJOR STEP FORWARD WITH THE CREATION OF A NOVEL HYBRID PRINTER THAT SIMPLIFIES THE PROCESS OF CREATING IMPLANTABLE CARTILAGE
FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE HAD SIGNED UP FOR IT

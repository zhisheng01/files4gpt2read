DO WHAT IS BEST FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND RETURN THE STUDENTS TO OUR SCHOOL FULL TIME NOW
IF THESE INDIVIDUALS THEN CONTINUE TO HAVE BABIES WITH THE MODERN HUMANS
AND THEN THIS GUY WILL DO THE AND AND JUMP AGAIN
AND HOW DOES IT MEET OUR OTHER GOALS THAT WE'VE ALWAYS HAD
THE PROCEDURE MAKES USE OF A CELLULAR MECHANISM SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH REPAIRS NERVE AXONS IN INVERTEBRATES
PREPARATIONS DUE TO THE THREAT
THERE MUST BE SOCIAL DISTANCING AS WELL AS A MANDATORY FACE COVERING FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR STUDENTS TEACHERS AND THEIR FAMILIES
ETHAN WAS BELOVED BY COUNTLESS NEIGHBORS
IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS BEFORE WE
AS AN ALTERNATIVE THE PRIMARY MANNER OF INSTRUCTION SHOULD BE ONLINE WITH IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AVAILABLE FOR THOSE FAMILIES WHO REALLY WANT OR NEED TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL
MY KIDS WILL ONLY GO TO SCHOOL IF MASKS ARE REQUIRED AND IF SOCIAL DISTANCING IS POSSIBLE
AND THEN ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY WHERE MULTIPLE STUDENTS COULD ASK QUESTIONS
AND SHE'S HAPPY HEALTHY EATING ICE CREAM AND A LITTLE VINO ONCE IN A WHILE
IS THIS BAD
IF YOU HAVE SOME EXISTING CODE THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO RUN IN THE WEB
PERFECT OKAY SO MAY I HAVE A MOTION PLEASE
THE TWENTY CENTIMETRE LONG CREATURE REPORTEDLY POSSESSED A UNIQUE FILTER FEEDING SYSTEM
I SENT THESE BUT I DID NOT GET A FULL RESPONSE I'M NOT GOING TO ASK ALL OF THE QUESTIONS
IN TERMS OF TAKING TIME TO EDUCATE STUDENTS IN WAYS THAT AREN'T IMMEDIATELY PRACTICAL
SHOULD BE FAIRLY OBVIOUS HOPEFULLY
NUMBERS ARE RISING AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SENDING THE KIDS BACK WITHOUT MASKS OR SANITATION PROCEDURES IN PLACE
THOSE MUTATIONS WE HAVE SORT OF AS A MODEL PUT INTO TRANSGENIC MOUSE SO THE MOUSE NOW MAKES A HUMAN VERSION OF THIS PROTEIN THAT SEEMS TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO IN HUMANS WITH LANGUAGE AND SPEECH

EXAMPLES OF CAVE ART IN SPAIN ARE DATED TO AROUND THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND BC MAKING THEM THE OLDEST EXAMPLES OF ART YET DISCOVERED IN EUROPE
WE GOT TO WORK
WE LEARN TO AUTOMATE VERY COMPLEX COORDINATION OF MOTOR MOVEMENTS IN OUR VOCAL CORDS
MASSACHUSETTS-BASED COMPANY RETHINK ROBOTICS RELEASES ITS BAXTER INDUSTRIAL ROBOT THE FIRST HUMANOID ROBOT DESIGNED TO APPLY COMMON SENSE AND MACHINE LEARNING TO FACTORY OPERATIONS
THE IMAGES PROVIDE PHOTOGRAPHIC PROOF OF DNA'S DOUBLE-HELIX STRUCTURE AND COULD FURTHER SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPOUND'S FUNCTION
WILL THEY HAVE I WOULD LIKE TO ASK AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THE EXTENDED LEARNING COMPONENT
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT MORE STEPS TO MITIGATE RISK ARE PUT IN PLACE
OKAY SO WHAT WE HAVE IS WE HAVE THE FIRST
WITH THE NEXT STEPS
OKAY
SO HERE IS WHERE WE ARE AT THIS POINT
IN ALL HURRICANE MITCH CAUSED AT LEAST THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FATALITIES IN NICARAGUA OF WHICH MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND WERE KILLED IN THE TOWNS OF EL PROVENIR AND ROLANDO RODRIGUEZ FROM THE LANDSLIDE AT THE CASITA VOLCANO
HOW DOES IT AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO TEACH
THE LACK OF WINDOWS THAT OPEN THE LACK OF SOAP IN THE BATHROOMS AND TOUCH POINTS IN THE SCHOOL CAMPUS DON'T MAKE US FEEL SAFE
YOUR JOB I APPRECIATE THAT BUT IT'S NOT YOUR JOB AND SO I ASKED QUESTIONS AND FOR STUFF LIKE THIS
YEAH THAT'S ONE HUGE ADVANTAGE OF NATIVE CODE EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT BE UNSAFE FROM SOME PERSPECTIVES
AND SO WE ARE CALLING THIS MODEL THE FULL DAY MAX SIXTEEN MODEL
RESEARCHERS AT HARVARD'S WYSS INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED ENGINEERING SUCCESSFULLY STORE FIVE POINT FIVE PETABITS OF DATA AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED TERABYTES IN A SINGLE GRAM OF DNA BREAKING THE PREVIOUS DNA DATA DENSITY RECORD BY A THOUSAND TIMES
TRUSTEE BARTO YOU'LL START
AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT JUST POPS UP AND ALERTS DIALOG BOX IN MY BROWSER
TRUSTEE BLACK MADE THE MOTION AND TRUSTEE ANDERSON SECOND
YOU MENTIONED EARLIER IN YOUR TALK THAT THERE ARE NO NEANDERTHAL MITOCHONDRIAL DNA IN HUMAN POPULATIONS
MOVE ADOPTION
THE KIDS NEED TO GET BACK TO IN PERSON LEARNING
THIS ONE IS ABOUT TRAINING
THE ONLY THING THAT STANDS OUT ARE TESTICLES
MUCH OF THE CITY WAS EVACUATED IN FEAR OF A REPEAT OF HURRICANE HATTIE THIRTY SEVEN YEARS EARLIER
WHERE DO SPORTS STAND
IF WE CAN'T EVEN EAT INSIDE A RESTAURANT BECAUSE IT'S TOO RISKY
AND SO THAT'S HOW THEY GET AROUND
I HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL IF YOU FIND THAT YOU HAVE MORE QUESTIONS PLEASE COME SEE A COUNSELOR WE ARE AVAILABLE ON DROP-IN OR BY APPOINTMENT AND WE'D LOVE TO HELP YOU TO ANSWER MORE OF YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU
THE AIR IN MANY CLASSROOMS IS STAGNANT
AND REMEMBER THERE ARE SUBHEADINGS UNDER A LOT OF THESE
THIS MODEL WOULD BE CONDUCIVE TO THAT AS WELL
THE MOST EXCITING PART OF IT IS THE DATA THAT WE'RE GATHERING
SHORTLY THEREAFTER THE STORM BECAME AN EXTRATROPICAL CYCLONE
ON ITS FACE THIS MODEL REFERS MOSTLY TO LOGISTICS AND IS VAGUE REGARDING EDUCATIONAL CONTENT
SO IF YOUR GOAL I GUESS IS TO SANDBOX NATIVE CODE
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO URGE YOU TO CONSIDER BEGINNING THE YEAR WITH DISTANCE LEARNING SINCE THE VIRUS IS SPREADING AND PEOPLE ARE NOT TAKING APPROPRIATE PRECAUTIONS
AND I CAN ALSO PERHAPS SAY THAT WE'RE VERY LUCKY I THINK THAT OUR FIRST NEANDERTHAL WE STUDIED WAS THE TYPE SPECIMEN THAT GAVE ITS NAME TO THIS GROUP OF HOMINIDS
AND WHEN A STUDENT'S PARENT IS POSITIVE WITH THIS MODEL
WAS DEMONSTRATED BY THREE BIG STANFORD CLASSES
I TALK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE AND WHILE MANY HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT IMPLEMENTING THE MODELS PROPOSED IN THE AGENDA ITEM THIRTEEN A APPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL MODELS
PUBLICIZE YOUR RESOLUTION BEFORE CANDIDATE FILING DEADLINES
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR HOW WE COULD DO IT ACTUALLY WITHOUT ANY HARDWARE SUPPORT COULD WE JUST ENFORCE ALL THE MEMORY ACCESSES GOING IN BOUNDS WITH THE MACHINE WE HAVE SO FAR
IT TAKES AWHILE THOUGH TO COLLECT ALL THE INFORMATION AND TO PUT IT INTO A FORMAT WHERE WE CAN
HOW OFTEN WILL CAMPUS BE SANITIZED CLEANED
AND SOME OF THEM WOULD BE INSIDE THE CLASSROOM MAX SIXTEEN
HYDROINFORMA
NO
NOT TO MENTION HOW MANY ARE BRINGING IT HOME TO GRANDPARENTS OR IMMUNE COMPROMISED PARENTS OR SIBLINGS AND THEY WILL VERY LIKELY LOSE FAMILY MEMBERS
YES
THE OTHER COMMENTS ARE ON AGENDA ITEMS
A FORMAL STUDY FINDS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF HEALTH BENEFITS FROM ORGANIC FOODS
NEANDERTHALS CONTRIBUTED HERE SO THAT WOULD THEN ALLOW US TO ESTIMATE THIS TO SOMEWHERE FIFTY TO SIXTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO
THANK YOU
SO THESE ARE THE CLASSES THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO TAKE IF YOU WERE ALREADY AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE
CHEMOTHERAPY
UPDATES AND THIS IS PART OF THE UPDATES THAT I'VE BEEN MENTIONING THAT WE WOULD DO IN SUBSEQUENT BOARD MEETINGS
EXEMPLIFIES THAT AS A LEADER
SO WE GET TWENTY ONE PLUS QUESTION MARK I WANT TO DO THAT GREEN COLOR
IN DUBLIN
THE CLASSES ON THE RIGHT ARE THE EQUIVALENT CLASSES AT DVC SO THIS IS EVERYTHING THAT YOU WILL TAKE FOR THAT MAJOR IN ORDER TO TRANSFER
YEAH
IT TAKES A LITTLE PRACTICE TO GET FAMILIAR WITH WHAT TERMS TO LOOK UP IN THE ALPHABETICAL INDEX
OKAY SO MR HALT ARE YOU STILL
PLUS QUESTION MARK
THE COMBINED DAMAGE TO TRANSPORTATION COMMUNICATION UTILITIES
THE US NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY HAS DEVELOPED A FORM OF UNDERWATER SOLAR ENERGY
WITHIN THE HOUR IT'S LIKE
AND OUR WILLING USE
BUT EXPECT MINIMAL CONSEQUENCES NUMBER FIVE
DO THE JOB YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO OPEN SCHOOLS AND EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN

IN A WORLD FIRST ASTRONOMERS AT COPENHAGEN UNIVERSITY REPORT THE DETECTION OF A SPECIFIC SUGAR MOLECULE GLYCOLALDEHYDE IN A DISTANT STAR SYSTEM
WHERE EDUCATION IS AVAILABLE

I'LL PICK UP ONE PERSON MATTHIAS MEYER WHO DEVELOPED THE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE THESE ULTRA SENSITIVE LIBRARIES THAT ALLOWED US TO GET THESE HIGH QUALITY GENOMES FROM DENISOVANS AND NEANDERTHALS
THE TREATMENT HALVED THE AMOUNT OF EXTANT SCAR TISSUE WITHIN A YEAR
ALL ELEVEN ARE NOT GOING TO PURSUE IT

THE DEVICE WHICH PROVIDES DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION AND HAS ALREADY BEEN USED BY SUFFERERS OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE COULD BOOST MEMORY AND REVERSE COGNITIVE DECLINE
SO THAT WOULD INSTRUMENT AN INSTRUCTION AND THAT WOULD TURN AN UNSAFE INSTRUCTION INTO ONE THAT'S ALWAYS SAFE TO EXECUTE BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS THAT CHECK IN FRONT OF IT
AND THERE WAS A BONE WASHED UP ON THE SHORE THERE

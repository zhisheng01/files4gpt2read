AND THIS IS LEARNING TECHNOLOGY GROUP MEETING
I E CLASS STUDENT HAS THREE CLASSES AND THREE GENERAL ED CLASSES
BIOTECH
THANK YOU BEFORE THE MEETING THANK YOU
AND THE STUDENT HAS TO REFLECT UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AND CHECK THE RIGHT BOXES BEFORE THEY CAN CONTINUE
AS A HOUSEHOLD WITH TWO WORKING PARENTS AND NO EXTENDED FAMILY WE FEEL THE PRESSURE
MR LEE-SUNG
IF YOU NEED TO TAKE THEIR TEMPERATURE TO PROVE THEY ARE NOT SICK
AND THEN THE OTHER HALF OF THE DAY EITHER IN THE MORNING OR THE AFTERNOON
IT'S NOT JUST EDUCATION SCHOOLS ARE PROVIDING IT'S INSPIRATION
THE OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO FOR MIGRAINE WAS UPLOADED VIA YOUTUBE AND VIMEO
LEFKOWITZ AND BRIAN KOBILKA
SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES THAT ARE CENTER OF OUR DISCUSSIONS AND DECISION MAKING AND RECOMMENDATIONS
COMMENT FROM NISREEN WITT
THAT INFORMATION TO TARGET OUR STUDENTS BEFORE BAD THINGS HAPPEN
AND THE MODEL WAS WE KNEW THERE HAD BEEN NEANDERTHALS IN THE MIDDLE EAST SO IF THIS EARLY MODERN HUMANS THAT CAME OUT MIXED WITH NEANDERTHALS AND THEN BECAME THE ANCESTORS OF EVERYBODY OUTSIDE AFRICA
YES SAFETY IS VITAL BUT THE OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN ALSO MATTERS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TRUCE WAS UPLOADED VIA YOUTUBE
ALL ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY SPECIFICALLY WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT OBJECTIVE HEALTH STANDARD WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE WHEN IT WILL BE SAFE TO RETURN TO SCHOOLS
J LETT
I WOULD LIKE THOSE TO BE READY TO SAFELY HAVE KIDS ON CAMPUS AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH
OKAY
BUT THERE'S STILL THAT IDEA OF ONCE THEY'RE DONE WITH THAT
WE HAD TARDY SWEEP
AND I WILL SAY THAT FACE COVERINGS WILL BE A REQUIREMENT FOR ALL PASSENGERS ON THE BUS
SO HERE'S ANOTHER INTERESTING QUESTION
QUESTION MARK IS GOING TO BE EQUAL TO
WHAT ASSURANCES CAN THE BOARD GIVE TO STAKEHOLDERS THAT THIS PLAN CAN BE IMPLEMENTED SAFELY
PRESENTATION
IF SOME PARENTS WANT TO HAVE THEIR KIDS AT HOME THE THREE PHASE APPROACH WILL HELP THERE
NORSE MYTHOLOGY
TEACHERS ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND LIKE DOCTORS AND NURSES WHO WORK WITH COVID PATIENTS AND STAY SAFE
INCLUDING WARM WATERS AND GOOD OUTFLOW
WITH CORONAVIRUS SPREADING LIKE WILDFIRE IN ORANGE COUNTY IT IS NOT SAFE TO REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS
IT IS IMPERATIVE FOR KIDS TO BE ON CAMPUS IN A SCHOOL LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR THEIR EDUCATION WHICH HAS SUFFERED DUE TO COVID AND FOR THEIR MENTAL HEALTH
THEY HEADED BACK TO CAMP BUT STOPPED ON THE WAY TO SURVEY A LITTLE GULLY
THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD THE BOARD WHEN HE INTERVIEWED I BELIEVE IN DISTRIBUTIVE LEADERSHIP I GET OUT OF THE WAY LET THEM DO THEIR JOB
WE AS A COMMUNITY CAN USE THE RESPONSE TO COVID NINETEEN TO IMPROVE OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR ALL TIME
ALL THEY NEEDED WAS THE HAT AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE MEN IN BLACK
AFTER DRIFTING SOUTHWESTWARD AND WEAKENING THE HURRICANE HIT HONDURAS AS A MINIMAL HURRICANE
THE CONSTRUCT IS CAPABLE OF SWIMMING IN A SIMILAR MANNER TO REAL JELLYFISH WHEN STIMULATED WITH AN ELECTRIC CURRENT
EVEN IN SMALL GROUPS THE ENTIRE EXPOSED GROUP WOULD HAVE TO BE TESTED AND QUARANTINED WHICH WILL INTERRUPT INSTRUCTION REPEATEDLY
LARGE VOLUMES OF METHANE A POTENT GREENHOUSE GAS COULD BE LOCKED BENEATH THE ANTARCTIC ICE ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY
BUT AMONG THEM
PARENTS
THIS WOULD EXTEND THE HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION TO THOSE INSTITUTIONS OF LESSER QUALITY
I DON'T WANT KIDS KIND OF COMING OR NOT COMING
WITH
SO WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT AND SO THAT WITH THAT WE ARE ADJOURNING
A COMPLETELY NEW METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THE SMALLEST STRUCTURES IN ELECTRONICS COULD MAKE THEIR MANUFACTURE THOUSANDS OF TIMES QUICKER ALLOWING FOR CHEAPER SEMICONDUCTORS
SCIENTISTS DISCOVER THE REMAINS OF AN ENORMOUS THREE BILLION YEAR OLD IMPACT NEAR THE MANIITSOQ REGION OF WEST GREENLAND A BILLION YEARS OLDER THAN ANY OTHER KNOWN COLLISION ON EARTH
NASA SCIENTISTS ANNOUNCE THE CURIOSITY ROVER'S DISCOVERY OF EVIDENCE OF ANCIENT FLOWING LIQUID WATER ON MARS
SPRAYING ENEMY INSECTS WITH TOXINS IN DEFENCE OF THEIR TERMITE MOUNDS
THIS JUST MAKES MORE SENSE
FRANCE GERMANY DENMARK AND OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE REOPENED SCHOOLS
WE FIND A LITTLE BIT OF GENE FLOW FROM DENISOVANS INTO MAINLAND ASIANS
A LOT OF THIS WILL ALSO DEPEND ON HOW MANY STUDENTS WE HAVE WITH INTEREST AND
IN OUR HOME WE BOTH WORK OUTSIDE THE HOME EVEN DURING THE PANDEMIC AND IT HAS BEEN NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO NAVIGATE DISTANCE LEARNING WITH THREE ELEMENTARY AGED CHILDREN
CAN MULTIPLY BOTH SIDES
GRADUATES ARE GENERALLY HAPPIER IN THEIR LIVES SUCCEED
TYPICALLY STRAIGHT AS AND I DON'T HAVE TO PUSH THEM MUCH TO EXCEL ACADEMICALLY
THE BAND RELEASED A MUSIC VIDEO ON YOUTUBE FOR AN UNRELEASED SONG CALLED GONER
IS THERE GOING TO BE SOME THOUGHT AS TO
A NEW GENETIC TEST CAN FULLY SEQUENCE THE GENOME OF A NEWBORN BABY IN JUST FIFTY HOURS A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT OVER THE USUAL MONTH-LONG SEQUENCING PROCESS
AND THAT IS IT THANK YOU
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE SCENARIO AGAIN
CLICK ON VIEW AGREEMENT
IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO CONTINUE IN THE FALL SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE FOR US TO CONSIDER IS POSSIBLY HAVING ONE SCHOOL FACILITATOR FOR EACH SCHOOL SITE
AND I ALWAYS CALLED THEM THAT I SAID THESE ARE THE MEN IN BLACK BECAUSE THEY CAME ON TO TAKE THE POSITIONS OF PRINCIPAL AT COSTA MESA HIGH SCHOOL AND CO-PRINCIPAL AT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL
AND SO I AM GOING TO ASK YOU TO RECONSIDER AND HAVE THE MEETING ON A TUESDAY EVENING SO THAT IF WE DO IT ON A FRIDAY
NO
AND I SAID YOU KNOW THAT'S PART OF WHAT POLITICS IS
ALL FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR STUDENTS
AND SHE WILL ALSO DESCRIBE SOME DETAILS OF THIS ELEMENTARY MODEL THAT WE'RE PROPOSING SO MR DRAKE
AND THE WAY THAT THIS ACTUALLY HELPS US TO ENFORCE MEMORY BOUNDS IS THAT ON X EIGHT SIX EVERY SINGLE INSTRUCTION IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
AND AGAIN IT RELIES ON VERY FEW GENES JUST FIVE GENES
THOSE THREE BOYS HAD GONE TO DR NAVARRO TO SET UP THIS JOKE TO PLAY ON THE COACH
OKAY
PLEASE PROVIDE A ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ONLINE LEARNING OPTION THROUGH EACH SCHOOL NOT IN A SEPARATE ONLINE ACADEMY
PARENTS
THERE WAS JEFF HUBBARD ANOTHER BOARD CHARMER AND EMPLOYEE BULLY WHO IS A CONVICTED FELON
THANK YOU

NASA DEMONSTRATES ITS X ONE POWERED EXOSKELETON A ROBOTIC ASSISTANCE SUIT BASED ON ITS ROBONAUT HUMANOID ROBOT
I SUPPORT GOING BACK TO SCHOOL HOWEVER
SO THAT I WANT TO BE UPFRONT AS WELL
AND
I ALSO WANT TO CODE THE HISTORY OF CHEMOTHERAPY FOR THE NEOPLASM
PUBLIC REQUESTS OF ITEMS TO BE DISCUSSED AND OR REMOVED SHOULD BE SUBMITTED IN WRITING PRIOR TO THE BOARD'S CONSIDERATION OF THE CONSENT CALENDAR
I KNOW STUDENTS BENEFIT FROM BEING IN CLASSROOMS WITH TEACHERS AND PEERS AND I WHOLEHEARTEDLY WANT TO BE BACK IN MY CLASSROOM

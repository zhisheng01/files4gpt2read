GERMAN PHYSICISTS DEVELOP THE WORLD'S FIRST UNIVERSAL QUANTUM COMPUTING NETWORK LINKING TWO LABORATORIES USING ENTANGLED RUBIDIUM ATOMS AS NETWORK NODES
EVEN WITH AIR CONDITIONERS FANS AND DOORS AND WINDOWS OPEN
AND HIGH SCHOOL
SHARP CORPORATION DEVELOPS A SOLAR CELL WITH THE HIGHEST SOLAR ENERGY CONVERSION EFFICIENCY YET ACHIEVED
SCIENTISTS WORKING ON THE BLUE BRAIN PROJECT HAVE ACHIEVED A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN MAPPING THE HUMAN BRAIN IDENTIFYING KEY PRINCIPLES THAT DETERMINE SYNAPSE-SCALE CONNECTIVITY AND MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT THE LOCATIONS OF SYNAPSES IN THE NEOCORTEX
SO THERE IS CERTAINLY A DIFFERENCE
NUMEROUS RIVERS EXCEEDED THEIR CRESTS THOUGH THE RAINFALL WAS BENEFICIAL TO TREES IN MOUNTAINOUS AREAS

THANK YOU
SAFETY RELIABLE NUTRITION
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON SCIENTISTS REPORT THAT INJECTING SULFATE PARTICLES INTO THE STRATOSPHERE WILL NOT FULLY OFFSET CLIMATE CHANGE
SO THE WAY IT WORKS IS ACTUALLY
ANXIETY DEPRESSION AND SUICIDAL IDEATION
IN DENMARK SOME PRELIMINARY DATA SUGGESTS THAT TEACHERS ARE NOT AN ESPECIALLY HIGH RISK GROUP
WILL MASKS BE REQUIRED FOR STAFF AND STUDENTS
A COST ANALYSIS OF THE TECHNOLOGIES NEEDED TO TRANSPORT MATERIALS INTO THE STRATOSPHERE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT HITTING EARTH AND THEREFORE REDUCE THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE SHOWS THAT THEY ARE BOTH FEASIBLE AND AFFORDABLE
WAS A SOILS ENVIRONMENT TEST DONE WHO PERFORMED IT ARE THE RESULTS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC
BUT IF YOU RECALL WITH THAT STRUCTURE THE FOCUS GROUPS AND THE ADVISORY COMMITTEES ON THE BOTTOM
I AM ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED TO INTRODUCE THIS PERSON TO YOU
AND IF YOU PICTURE THIS AND I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT THEY BOTH HAD BLACK GLASSES ON

COULD BE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO ADDRESS IT
AT THE EUROMOLD TRADE SHOW IN GERMANY MANUFACTURERS DISPLAY NUMEROUS ADVANCES IN COMMERCIAL THREE D PRINTING TECHNOLOGY INCLUDING A DEVICE THAT CAN RAPIDLY PRINT AN ENTIRE BICYCLE

BENIGN
THEY GET TO BE WITH KIDS INTERACT AND GROW AND LEARN FROM EACH OTHER

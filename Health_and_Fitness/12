HOW DID THEY GET THIS
SO WHEN MEN HANG AROUND TOO LONG
ONE OF MY FAVORITE HERBS OF ALL TIME IS ROSEMARY WE GROW SO MUCH OF IT IN MY GARDEN HERE
YOU REALIZE IN LIGHTS OUT YOU READ IT
THEIR RATIO OF OMEGA SIX TO OMEGA THREE ISN'T TREMENDOUSLY BETTER
THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD NEVER SAY AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THIS CAME OUT OF A SEGMENT THAT I DID FOR LISA SASEVICH YOU KNOW LISA
I WANT TO TELL YOU NOTHING ON THIS LIST THAT I KNOW OF HAS BEEN TESTED AGAINST CORONAVIRUS
AND ABUNDANCE DIGITAL IS A GROUP OF RIGHT NOW ABOUT THREE THOUSAND ENTREPRENEURS WE'LL CAP IT AT TEN
AND BECAUSE I'M TALKING ABOUT IS DR SAUNDRA DALTON-SMITH WHO'S A BOARD CERTIFIED INTERNAL MEDICINE PHYSICIAN
BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S ESTERIFIED MEANING IT'S LESS BULKY
PUT IN YOUR MIND ALL THE THINGS YOU WANT
THERE'S NO NARRATIVE
SO
AND THE SAME THING WITH YOUR REALITY IF YOU'RE IN A NEGATIVE PLACE
IF YOU PUT THE BRAKE ON IT ALL OF THE TIME
IF WE RAN UP A STAIR OR JUST BY BREATHING WE WOULD GET HIT
OR ARE YOU HAPPY TO ACTUALLY PAY THAT COST TOWARDS THE END OF LIFE
IS GOOD TO FIGHT OFF A VIRUS INFECTION
THE ART IS IN TAKING THE SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES WHAT ARE THOSE PRINCIPLES
RIGHT WHICH PUTS YOU IN A DIRECTION OTHER ONES ARE
DO YOU EVER LIKE WALK DOWN THE STREET AND JUST BE LIKE PHYSICAL
AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME AND A LOT OF MONEY AND I DID IT
IS HOLLYWOOD IT'S THE BIG TIME
YOU'RE IN THE BOOK
HIS COVID TEAM
SO THAT'S REALLY THE FIRST STEP IN BECOMING A GREAT COMMUNICATOR IS UNDERSTANDING THAT EVEN ELVIS HAD ISSUES AND IT'S COOL CLINT YOU DIDN'T
TODAY'S GUEST IS ACTUALLY NOT A SPIDER
OH COME ON
IF YOU'RE PRACTICING INTERMITTENT FASTING
DRUMMING
AND THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM'S GOING TO CRASH
I MEAN YOU'VE GOT WAY MORE EXPERIENCE LOOKING AT BRAINS THAN I DO
IT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU
FOR PEACE FOR BLISS
THEN BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS GOING TO USURP DAVE IN THIS BLOODLESS COUPE
SO AFTER SHE FINISHED THE EXPERIMENT PEOPLE STARTED TO SLIP AND THEY SAID WELL
THESE WILL BECOME MORE AND MORE FAMILIAR TO YOU THAN WHEN YOU REFLECT ON THEM
WHAT I SAY TO THEM IS I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU GOT INTO ADDICTION IS BECAUSE YOU HAD EMOTIONAL PAIN
I KNOW A REALLY FAST WAY TO MAKE GLUCOSE
I DON'T FEEL AS FULFILLED IN LIFE WITH ANYTHING ELSE
I AGREE
EXPRESSIONS WITH YOUR FACE BEING AN EXPRESSIVE PERFORMER
BUT SHE WAS DOING ALL THIS WORK IN THE MEANWHILE
IF SOMEONE CAME TO YOU TOMORROW AND SAID
MY MOM LIKES TO TELL ME I'M A DESCENDANT OF THE PHARAOHS
AND THAT'S PART OF YOUR INHERITANCE
HONEY EVERY TIME I DO THIS
WHICH INITIALLY CAUSE AN INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE JUST LIKE YOUR FINGER
AND I DON'T MEAN YOUR TURTLE
WHAT CIRCADIAN RHYTHM FIELD IS DOING
AND THEY ARE CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE THRESHOLD OF CONSCIOUSNESS
BUT NO ONE TOLD ME THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS COMMON WEIRD CULTURAL PERCEPTION THAT THAT'S WHAT IT IS
IT'S ACTUALLY TAKEN SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF MARKET SHARE FROM OTHER COMPANIES THAT WERE USING WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER TO BE
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS BUT IT'S THE ONLY THING I'VE FOUND THAT WORKED FOR ME
TURN ON A TANK VALVE TAKE A BREATH AND TURN IT OFF
NOW IF YOU COULDN'T COMPLETE IT SUCCESSFULLY YOU NEEDED THE FORCEPS OR
SO I HAD TO CALM HER DOWN I HAD TO GET HER UN-WEDGED
I SUSPECT THAT WE CAN DO IT
ALL RIGHT IF YOU LIKE THIS EPISODE YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO
BEING FAT
WE FED HIGH QUALITY FOOD AND THE CHARCOAL
IT CAN BE BROUGHT IN THAT TRANSPORTER AND THEN YOU HAVE A WHOLE SET OF SENSING MOLECULES INSIDE THE CELL THAT SAYS HEY DO YOU HAVE TOO MUCH OF THIS STUFF IN YOU
AMPUTATIONS AND KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATIONS DIABETES DIABETES
THREE DAYS IN A ROW ONE DAY OFF
POTENTIAL
HYDROXY PROGESTERONE IS FROM YOUR ADRENALS DAY ONE TO FOURTEEN
SO JAMES WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW HI DAVE THANKS FOR HAVING ME BACK YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF AS A TRANSHUMANIST AND YET YOU WROTE A BOOK TALKING ABOUT INTERMITTENT FASTING
IT TURNS OUT THAT OUR BLOOD VESSEL CELLS HAVE THE RECEPTOR FOR NICOTINE THEY'VE GOT A NICOTINIC ACID RECEPTOR
THE SWING WAS SOMETHING LIKE EIGHTY PERCENT BETWEEN YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING OUT OR STAYING IN IT WAS JUST BASED ON HOW MANY DECISIONS THE BOARD HAD MADE THERE WAS A SLIGHT SPIKE AFTER LUNCH THEY GOT ENERGY FROM THEIR FOOD FOR A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE THE FOOD COMA HIT AND YOU MIGHT GET OUT IF YOU GOT THAT FIRST MEETING AFTER LUNCH
SO AGAIN I PREFER THE LOW-GLYCEMIC VEGETABLES BROCCOLI CAULIFLOWER ASPARAGUS SPINACH
A COUPLE INTERESTING THINGS HAPPEN
LIVER SAYS IT NEEDS TO STAY DETOXIFIED ALSO BECAUSE IT'S WORKING WITH THE KIDNEYS HOW ARE YOU DOING ARE YOU OKAY
YOU SEE HE WAS ALREADY EXHAUSTED
SO THERE WAS TWO THINGS THAT WE DID
WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE SOUND LIKE SMELL LIKE AND IT STARTS BRINGING IN THAT DATA
SUZY
THERE'S A LIGHT INSIDE OF YOU THAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND ONCE YOU SIT STILL AND CONNECT TO YOUR BREATH AND FEEL GROUNDED IN THAT
SO YOU'RE ACUTELY STROKING OR YOU'RE ACUTELY HAVING A HEART ATTACK
YOU'RE SO DISCONNECTED RIGHT BECAUSE THE TENDENCY IN SPIRITUALITY IS
YEAH
HEAVY-DUTY MEDICAL TOME WITH THIS ENTIRELY
SOMETIMES THEY WAKE UP AND THEN THEY'RE STILL TIRED THEY CHECK THEIR EMAIL AND OTHER STUFF BEFORE THEY GET OUT OF THEIR BED
BUT IF I GIVE THEM A BRAIN OCTANE SO THEY GET EXOGENOUS KETONES FROM THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO READ THE LAW IT'S GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE SCIENCE ABOUT WHY THAT LAW HAS MERIT ABOUT THE PRACTICE OF THE PEOPLE WHO DID IT
GOT INVOLVED IN THE MUSIC SCENE IN LONDON
THAT'S UP TO YOU
AND A TOP-RATED PROFESSOR AT WHARTON A NEW YORK TIMES COLUMNIST A TED TALK FAVORITE AND JUST AN AMAZING GUY WHO'S WHO'S VERY WELL KNOWN FOR LOOKING AT HOW HUMANS INTERACT
WE'LL BUILD ALL THE MATERIALS AND WE WON'T CHARGE YOU UNTIL WE ACTUALLY SHIP
YOUR MIND'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO ACTIVATE THAT CODE
WHERE IT'S LIKE THE GIANT EPIC SUCCESS AND THEN THE GIANT EPIC COLLAPSING OF THAT SUCCESS BECAUSE IT WAS DRIVEN BY THIS PAIN
IVAN PETROVICH PAVLOV
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WONDERING
HE'S SPECIAL
THE GRASS GROWING REALLY THICK AND DENSE AND THE CHICKENS MOVING ON AND THREE MONTHS LATER THE COWS COME THROUGH AND GRAZE
HOW DO YOU KNOW MR CARRERA
BRING ME SOME
I HAD TO SAY TO MYSELF
YOU'RE COMING IN THERE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION
BUT I THINK THIS IS REALLY REALLY REALLY WORTH PAYING ATTENTION TO
WHERE THEY ARE

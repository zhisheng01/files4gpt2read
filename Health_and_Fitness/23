EXPOSING PEOPLE TO A VERY POWERFUL STROBOSCOPIC LIGHT
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS
LIKEWISE MELATONIN SUPPLEMENTATION IF YOU NEED IT WE ALSO KNOW THAT OVER-TRAINING OR LONG ENDURANCE TRAINING IS NOT GOOD FOR IL SIX
AND YOU SEE STUDIES THAT IMPLY MAY COULD
MY THREE YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER WHO NEVER SAID A WORD MIGHT TALK
THEY CHECK THEIR CELL PHONE OR THEIR TABLET
THE PACING I WAS USING THE INFLECTION I WAS USING
SHOCKS THE HAIR FOLLICLES
LET'S SAY THEY GO AND EAT A BAGEL WITH WHATEVER THEY'RE LIKE MY STOMACH IS KILLING ME I FEEL LIKE SHIT ALL DAY
ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A GOAL OR A PLAN TO BE OPTIMAL IF YOU HAVE A GOAL OR A PLAN TO BE OPTIMAL AND THEN YOU'RE DOING THINGS THAT ARE AGAINST THAT PLAN
IT'S EITHER ONE OR TWO PATTERNS USUALLY
AND
HERE'S THE QUESTION
IN ENDOCRINOLOGY AND I WORKED WITH AN ENDOCRINOLOGIST MANY PEOPLE MAY HAVE HEARD OF NAMED DIANA SCHWARZBEIN IN SANTA BARBARA
AND I ACTUALLY WONDER I DID HAVE LOW WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT AT THE TIME A LOW NEUTROPHIL COUNT ACTUALLY
I JUST REMEMBER
AND NOW WE'RE
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK IN PLANTS
WELL-CREDENTIALED AND SHE'S TALKING TO US FROM BIRMINGHAM ALABAMA WHERE SHE PRACTICES
WHERE WOULD THAT HAVE COME FROM SO THEN I GO BACK IN AND I START LIKE REPROGRAMMING
AND I WAS REALLY
IF WE'RE FEELING ALL THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE OBSESSING ABOUT THAT GETS TRANSMITTED
STRONGEST
WOW THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT RIGHT
MAYBE IT'S ME
ATTACHMENTPROJECT DOT COM SLASH DAVE
SO BEGIN TO DO THAT NOW
AND EVEN DID A SERIES OF WEB CELEBRITY INTERVIEWS CALLED CLOSET TALK TV
WHERE I CAN SEE EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING TO BE INVOLVED IT'S LIKE AN ORIENTATION
PARTLY BECAUSE OF FERTILITY PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'VE DONE TO OUR ENVIRONMENT
BUT WHEN THERE'S A WITNESS OR IDEALLY SEVERAL
AND SO THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
I SAT WITH MY WIFE AT THE TIME
DON'T MESS AROUND POKING HOLES IN YOUR GUT LINING
YOU HAVE MOST OF YOUR DEEP SLEEP IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE NIGHT AND YOU HAVE MOST OF YOUR REM SLEEP IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE NIGHT
IT'S JUST NOT THAT
DO YOU TELL THEM TO DO THINGS AS A RESULT OF WHAT YOU EXPERIENCED OR TO NOT DO THINGS
I AM AN OBESE COUCH POTATO
SO
PRESUMABLY
IT'S AN ANTI-ANXIOLYTIC SO YOU'RE CALMING DOWN
BECAUSE YOUR UNCONSCIOUS THROWS THAT UP THERE FOR A REASON
HEALTHY PARENTS ARE TOTALLY EFFUSIVE ALL THE TIME ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT THEIR KID DOES
BUT THEN
SAFETY AND PROTECTION IS THE FIRST
SAID
YOU MIGHT'VE HEARD THE LAST INTERVIEW WITH HIM WHERE WE TALKED ABOUT NEW WAYS TO DO ENDURANCE EXERCISE THAT DON'T BEAT YOU UP AS WELL
LIKE THE BEST WORK I'VE EVER SEEN OUT THERE
AND YOU LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGE OF THE TIME THAT I WOULD HAVE THETA STATES WHEN I WAS ASLEEP IT WAS VANISHINGLY SMALL
REM SLEEP BEING SO ESSENTIAL
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE GETTING MORE LIGHT
SO
WHEREAS GETTING A SIGNAL EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT WAS NEARLY INVISIBLE AND EFFORTLESS BECOMES MUCH MUCH MORE VALUABLE SO EVEN A WRISTBAND WHEN I WAS AT BASIS WE DIDN'T HIT THAT CONVENIENCE LEVEL
AND I'LL DO IT EVEN RIGHT NOW IS
AND SO
AND SO
IF YOU HAD A HIGH DEFINITION FIBER TRACTOGRAPHY EXAMINATION
WE'VE YOU KNOW EVERY TIME OUR PRACTICE OUR ANALYSTS TAKE A HARD AND FAST LOOK AT THE GUT BIOME STUFF
AND THERE'S A STRESS ASSOCIATED WITH PERFORMANCE THAT THERE'S ASSOCIATED WITH JUST BEING PROFESSIONAL
WHICH WE NOW UNDERSTAND BASED ON A WEEK-OLD STUDY OUT OF WUHAN
AND HE WAS TELLING ME THAT
THAT FEELING OF BEING ENOUGH IS A RESTORATION OF SAFETY
YOU SAID SOMETHING ON SOCIAL MEDIA RECENTLY YOU SAID PRODUCTIVITY ISN'T A VIRTUE IT'S A MEANS TO AN END
COME HOME FROM SCHOOL DO THAT AGAIN
FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME WHERE THEY ACTUALLY CAN DO PRETTY WELL WITHOUT EATING
YOU MUTATE TO LIVE YOU CHANGE TO LIVE
RIGHT SO FOR SURE
HAVING A TEACHER IS SO LEGIT READ THE BOOKS DO THE COURSES USE THE SOFTWARE ALL THAT
THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
AND IT'S VERY RELATED TO INTERMITTENT FASTING
THAN IT IS TO SAY YES AND THEN DROP THE BALL LATER OH YEAH IT IS MUCH HIGHER INTEGRITY TO DO THAT
AND BY THE WAY ALL THAT STUFF IS TRUE
YOU NEED TO TRAIN HARDER YOU NEED TO TRAIN MORE
SHE WAS MY MAIN CLINICAL MENTOR
PART OF THIS IS
IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN TO A HOSPITAL
DID IT CHANGE YOU I SAY WELL
FROM THE NECK DOWN UNLESS YOU'RE HAVING SEX OR EXERCISING
YOU FOUND A RESOURCE THAT STOPPED THE PAIN TEMPORARILY
ARE TERRIBLE PREDICTORS OF THE CURRENT ONE OR OF THE FUTURE
IN ALL THE WAYS THAT YOU CAN
AND IF SO WE NEED TO GET IT OUT SO WE'RE GONNA KICK IT OUT THROUGH THAT ATP BINDING CASSETTE
THAT WAS BEING STORED IN A BETA BRAINWAVE STATE A VERY ACTIVE HIGH DEFINITION STATE
YOU OPERATE OUT OF THAT BEST AND STRONGEST SENSE OF SELF
THAT'S MOSTLY WHAT I DO
WHERE WE TURN THE LIGHTS OFF AND TAKE THEIR PHONES AWAY AND THEIR COMPUTERS
YOUR REASONING ABILITY AND MANUAL DEXTERITY CAN SLOW DOWN
WHEN YOU FOCUS MORE INWARD YOU'LL FEEL EVEN MORE CALM AND RELAXED
WHEN YOU ARE A CARB AND SUGAR BURNER
HOW WOULD YOU RECOMMEND SOMEONE LISTENING KNOWS WHEN THEY'RE ABOUT TO MAKE A DECISION THAT MIGHT BE OUT OF INTEGRITY
NOT JUST ANTIOXIDANTS AND THEY SIGNAL TO THE BACTERIA WHICH THEN SIGNAL TO YOUR BACTERIA
LIMIT THAT SECOND THING
I GOT OUT OF THE BED
I GOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO QUIET MY MIND
AND WHAT WE KNOW SO THESE ARE PEOPLE WITH
BUT IN THIS CASE
YOU APPRECIATE WORKING OUT YOU WANT TO LOOK GOOD FOR THE GIRLS
NO
I DON'T KNOW TEN CUPS OF TEA A DAY
WHAT'S IT ACTUALLY GOING TO DO FOR ME VERSUS WHERE I COULD PUT THAT OTHER TWO HOURS OF TIME

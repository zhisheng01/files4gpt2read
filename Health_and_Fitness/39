WILL IT CHANGE AGAIN UNDOUBTEDLY SO
THEY SHIFTED THEIR SCHOOL START TIMES FROM SEVEN THIRTY FIVE IN THE MORNING TO EIGHT FIFTY FIVE
AND THE MORE YOU REFLECT ON THIS SCENE
WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING THERE'S NOTHING HAPPENING RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO PROBLEM OR CHALLENGE IN FRONT OF ME WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE SUN IS SHINING
THAT'S THE SYSTEM I CHANGED THE WAY I DO MY TESTOSTERONE I USED A CREAM FOR A LONG TIME
AND THIS IS SUPER UNUSUAL
WHOA
AND WHEN YOU ASK ABOUT A PERIOD YOU HAVE CHOICES AS A WOMAN
IN THE DAYS AFTERWARDS THERE WAS A BLAST RADIUS IMPACT OF THAT READING
JUST A GUY I HAD BEEN DOING YOGA AT HIS HOUSE EVERY MORNING FOR THIRTY YEARS
JUST NEVER LIKED THE JOB
ONE OF MY GREAT MENTORS
LET'S SEE I'M DIABETIC
WE KNOW FROM THE DATA AND THERE IS WONDERFULLY POWERFUL DATA THAT IS I COVER IT ALL IN THE BOOK
THE EMOTIONS EXPLODED AGAIN I WAS LIKE
IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN EAT
HOW ARE YOU GUYS HANDLING THE ANIMAL WELFARE SIDE OF THIS
I NEVER MADE IT THROUGH SCHOOL WITHOUT FALLING ASLEEP IN AT LEAST HALF MY CLASSES EVERY SINGLE DAY
THIS IS YOUR LIST OF BIG GUNS
HE LECTURES AND LEADS HOLOTROPIC BREATHWORK AND TRANSPERSONAL PSYCHOLOGY PROGRAMS AND WORKSHOPS ALL OVER THE WORLD
THIS HAS BECOME PART OF HUMAN LONGEVITY
IN AN UNCHECKED MANNER THAT IS ABSOLUTELY AN AUTOIMMUNE RESPONSE
THERE'S NO GUARANTEES
OH I'M DEPRESSED
BUT A LITTLE BIT OF A BAD THING IS A GOOD THING
BUT THEN WHEN I STARTED TRYING TO GET MORE SLEEP AND IT WASN'T SOLVING MY FATIGUE
MAKE THIS PRETTY CLEAR IN FACT SO MUCH SO THAT
BUT CARDIOMYOCYTES SO YOUR HEART'S GOING TO BE WEAKER
I TAKE MELATONIN BEFORE I GO TO BED I TAKE SEASONAL MELATONIN THAT OF COURSE I INVENTED
NOW I HAVE THAT LUXURY I CAN PUT PEOPLE AROUND ME TO DO THINGS THAT I DON'T PARTICULARLY LOVE
THE SECOND THING I WOULD DO IS TO DEVELOP A GRATITUDE PRACTICE IF YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE ONE
YOU CAN TELL RIGHT
STAY HERE YOU NEED THIS YOU NEED THAT YOU NEED HEALTH INSURANCE THEY WERE
AND ONE BY ONE
AND YOU'RE DOING GOOD WORK
V VISUALIZE HOW TO MAKE THEM HAPPEN AND E
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE A MUCH HARDER TIME GETTING PHYTOSTEROLS OUT OF THEIR SYSTEM SO STEROLS CAN
TWO ONE FULLY AWAKE AND SETTLED IN YOUR EXPERIENCE
YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
GREEN TEA ESPECIALLY MATCHA GREEN TEA WOULD BE ON THAT LIST
OKAY THAT'S HOW IT WORKS
I HAVE TO GO BACK TO WHAT I LEARNED FROM MY FAVORITE PROFESSOR IN THE ENTREPRENEURSHIP DEPARTMENT AT WHARTON MYLES BASS REST IN PEACE LOVE THAT GUY
THANK YOU FOR THIS BREATH THANK YOU FOR MY VISION
AND I TALK ABOUT THEM IN ONE OF THE CHAPTERS
THAT WENT ON FOR ABOUT SIX EIGHT MONTHS AND THEN SHE STARTED TO PUT TOGETHER REAL SENTENCES
HOW DO YOU CONTRAST THOSE TWO THINGS MAYBE I'M JUST ASKING THE SAME THING TWICE
RIGHT
SO
AND THAT ACTUALLY HELPS TO DROP THE BODY TEMPERATURE THEY CAN GO TO SLEEP A COOL SHOWER YEAH
PART OF THAT IS JOINING A COMMUNITY
IF YOU'LL STAY WITH IT
AND
NOW SHOULD YOUNGER KIDS GO THROUGH THESE THINGS THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO A TWELVE HOUR CHALLENGE BUT WHAT YOUNGER KIDS IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION GO THROUGH A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A CHALLENGING ROUTINE
AND I REMEMBER THINKING THAT IS WEIRD MAN
HAVE AN AWESOME DAY
SO YOU SEE PRO ATHLETES COME IN
THEY EITHER YAWN OR SHIT ON IT
SHE GOES THOSE AREN'T TWINKLING LIGHTS THOSE ARE PEOPLE'S SOULS THAT ARE BEING LOST
DRUM ROLL TESTOSTERONE
WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME INTERMITTENT FASTING WITH THESE GUYS WE FED THEM ONCE A DAY
BALE OUT
LIKE GUYS WERE LIKE I'M GOING TO GET BIG
THAT'S WHEN THE GOLD HAPPENED
VERSUS JUST LIVING WITH THE PAIN OR THE SUFFERING ALL THE TIME
WHICH I LOVE
I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR ANY KIND OF PERFORMER
THE AMOUNT OF MEDICAL WASTE COMING OUT OF HOSPITALS BECAUSE OF STERILITY REQUIREMENTS OH MY GOD YOU THINK YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON BECAUSE YOU RECYCLE
AND SO YOU NEED ACCESS TO THAT DATA TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT
SO MY LATE WIFE CHRISTINA AND I DEVELOPED A CONCEPT OF SPIRITUAL EMERGENCY CRISIS OF SPIRITUAL OPENING
RUNNING THROUGH WHEELING WEST VIRGINIA
IT'S AN EASY WAY TO SHOW GRATITUDE
IN THE SPEAKING GAME I TALK ABOUT THAT AS BEING EXPRESSIONS
IT'S COMPLETELY INAUTHENTIC IT REQUIRES SO MUCH ENERGY TO SUFFER
AND EVERY SYSTEM HAS ITS OWN INHERENT SET OF LIMITATIONS
I LIVED WITH THE PAIN OF REGRET OF NOT SUCCEEDING
I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE WAKE-UP TIME IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS HOW MANY HOURS YOU SLEPT
WHO ARRIVED AT A MEETING ONE DAY
BUT A BRITISH FINANCE MINISTER DOESN'T KNOW
SUGGESTIONS ONE WAS THAT THIS COULD CREATE EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOSIS
SO IT'S IN THE COW'S BEST INTEREST TO INCREASE GROWTH AS MUCH AND QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
YOU COULD ACTUALLY SPEND HUGE AMOUNTS OF TIME JUST MONITORING ALL SORTS OF THINGS
AND I WENT IN DRINKING A DOUBLE
BUT ASIDE FROM THAT WHAT GOES WRONG WITH THE VEGAN DIET
AS TIME GOES ON I THINK THE SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO IS GOING DOWN NOT UP
AND I REMEMBER GOING TO A STEAKHOUSE
BUT IF YOU START
BUT AFTER GETTING THE PRINCIPLES DOWN AND DOING FOR ME WRITING BOOKS IS ONE THING THAT MAKES ME BUILD FRAMEWORKS TO UNDERSTAND THINGS REALLY WELL AT THIS POINT
YOU KNOW
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING YOU IN PERSON ONE OF THESE DAYS
BECAUSE LIFE IS SHORT
YEAH SO THANKS FOR HAVING ME
TODAY'S GUEST IS LIGHT WATKINS
FOLLOWERS CLIENTS CUSTOMERS WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM CAN REPLICATE YOUR SUCCESS
THE MUSCLES GO YOU KNOW
AND I ENDED UP CONTINUING THAT FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND THAT SAID
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THE OTHER THING THAT'S REALLY AMAZING IS THAT
ALL THE INFLUENCE THAT THAT HAS
SO I SAID
AND EVERY TIME THAT WE WOULD GO TO SEE ONE OF THESE INCREDIBLE BEINGS
AND THOSE CAN BE GOOD FOR YOU ANOTHER SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT ON THE PODCAST AWHILE BACK WAS TREHALOSE

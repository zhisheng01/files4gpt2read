WHICH YOU COULD ALSO CALL THE SCIENCE OF HAPPINESS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA
WHEN I CAME BACK TO THE BODY LATER ON AFTER I CAME OUT OF MY COMA AND ALL THAT WHEN I WAS SITTING IN MY WHEELCHAIR FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
AND THEN THROUGH YOUR OWN RESEARCH YOU STARTED LOOKING AT WHAT HEALTH REALLY IS AND WHAT PERFORMANCE REALLY IS AND YOU CREATED A PERSONAL TREATMENT PLAN WITH DIET MINDSET LIFESTYLE AND A BUNCH OF TARGETED MEDICAL PROCEDURES
PICK UP A COPY OF GAME CHANGERS AND GET FIVE HUNDRED EPISODES BOILED DOWN WITH A STATISTICIAN INTO ACTIONABLE ADVICE
SETTLE BACK AND FOCUS ON YOUR BREATHING
IF YOU CAN SHOW UP FULLY PRESENT AND FULLY IN THE PRACTICE OF GRATITUDE AND GRACE
IT ALSO BREAKS DOWN A LOT OF
I MEAN THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF TESTS YOU CAN DO
AND THEN BECAUSE I'M SO GOOD AT TAKING FAT OUT OF STORAGE AND USING IT AS ENERGY
I DO A LOT OF DIVING IN THE POLAR REGIONS BUT THE ONE PROJECT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WAS WHEN I WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO CAVE DIVE INSIDE AN ICEBERG
AND SO THAT WAS MY FIRST GLIMPSE OF CRISIS
IN YOUR BOOK
HOW DO YOU DO THAT
SOME OLD THING FROM I DON'T KNOW WHEN SHE WAS A KID SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I'M LIKE LOOKED AT HER
THEN THEY'D BE GETTING PLENTY OF LEUCINE
SO WHAT I BELIEVE IS ALSO ANOTHER THING THAT I THINK PROBABLY MOST PEOPLE KNOW IS I HAVEN'T HAD INVESTORS AND I HAVEN'T HAD ANY LOANS SO I BUILT THE COMPANY WITHOUT ANY DEBT
YOU MIGHT BE OFF POINT RIGHT NOW
YOU HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCE
MORE BUREAUCRACY
HOW MIGHT I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY PART BUT
I INTERVIEWED
IT'S CALLED BUTTER
I THINK YOU'RE DOING GREAT WORK IN THE WORLD AND THANK YOU THANK YOU YOUR WEBSITE IS
BUT MOST OF US JUST SEE WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US WE CAN SEE THE TABLE WE CAN SEE THE CHAIRS WE CAN SEE EACH OTHER
T THREE THEN BECOMES AN INACTIVE FORM OF THE THYROID HORMONE R T THREE REVERSE T THREE
BUT WHEN YOU RESTRICT THE CALORIES DO YOU CARE WHAT KIND OF CALORIES THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY
IT ACTUALLY WORKS IT REDUCED MY SENSITIVITY
AND THERE
BECAUSE VARIOUS WHITE BLOOD CELLS GO TO THE SITE
I'M LOSING WEIGHT I'M TRAINING TOWARDS MY IDEAL BODY COMPOSITION
AND I THINK BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW WE NEED PHYSICAL REST
I JUST DIDN'T
IT'S THE FIRST STEP OF THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD IT'S CALLED OBSERVATION
A BUSINESS WITH A MISSION IS SHAMONIC AND A BUSINESS WHOSE JOB IS JUST TO MAKE MONEY IS PROBABLY EVIL
WOW
BUT THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT DRIVES YOU TO GO LITERALLY INTO THE PLANET WHICH BY THE WAY IS THE NAME OF YOUR BOOK
I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW
SO THIS IS AN EXCITING STUDY THAT CLEARLY SHOWS THAT IN MODERN DAYS IT'S NOT IDEAL TO WAKE UP SO EARLY AND MAYBE FOR SOME PEOPLE AT LEAST FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF OUR FUTURE
AND
GIVE ME A
I MET WITH BIOMARKER PHARMACEUTICALS THESE ARE THE FIRST GUYS TO SEE WHAT GENE EXPRESSION CHANGED WITH USING METFORMIN
AND IT WAS DEEMED A REVOLUTION
BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO APPROACH THAT
IT'S JUST PURE SCIENCE AND THERE'S GOING TO BE DEATH NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO
AND YOU WERE TO EAT A POUND OF BEEF A YEAR
THAT I WAS GOING TO TRANSFORM WHO I WAS AND HOW I WAS SHOWING UP IN THIS WORLD SO THAT I COULD TRY TO DIG MYSELF OUT OF THIS DITCH AND IF I COULD DO THAT THEN TRULY ANYTHING IN THE WORLD IS POSSIBLE
SO WHEN YOU DO THAT
THAT'S CALLED SECURE ATTACHMENT
THEY BELIEVE IN SACRIFICING I DON'T BELIEVE IN SACRIFICING I LOVE ANIMALS HOWEVER A LOT OF MY AFRICAN FRIENDS IN NIGERIA AND ALL OVER
WHICH MAKES IT EASIER NOW FOR ME TO SAY I'M GOING TO DESIGN MY JOB I'M A CEO
EXPANDED PERSPECTIVE
I WOULD ADVISE DAVE TO SAY WELL I'M SORRY SIR
EVERYTHING FROM OUTSIDE STAYS OUTSIDE IF YOU HAVE A GARAGE USE YOUR GARAGE AS A DECONTAMINATION UNIT LEAVE EVERYTHING COUPLE OF DAYS WIPE EVERYTHING DOWN COME IN
AND WHEN I FIRST SAW THE RING I JUST LOOKED AT AND SAID HOW DID YOU GET THE SENSORS AND THE BATTERY IN THERE
AND SO ONCE WE GET THEIR MIND TO STOP LOOPING THROUGH THE TRAUMA
WHICH BY THE WAY I DON'T BELIEVE IN
NUTRITION QUALITY QUANTITY
AND SO THEIR LONGEVITY IS ACTUALLY DESPITE THEIR LIFESTYLE NOT BECAUSE OF IT
SO I WOULD SAY LOOK
WITH TURMERIC
AND SIZE FORTY SIX INCH PANTS
SAYING HEY COULD YOU JUST SIT DOWN FOR AN HOUR AND HELP ME CRACK MY HEALTH PROBLEMS
AND SO I STARTED SHARING THAT KNOWLEDGE
IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS HOUSEHOLD INCOME
I'M A LITTLE TIRED BUT I'M JUST GONNA SHAKE IT OFF
THEY'VE REPAIRED THE ESTEEM
NOW SHE'S JUST REALLY FUNNY
IT'S GONE
I BELIEVE THAT YOUR DIET
IT TURNS THAT IF YOU EAT A LOT OF PLANTS
CONTROLLING WHO YOU'RE AROUND AND IF YOU CAN'T CONTROL THE PEOPLE YOU'RE AROUND CONTROL THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE TAKING IN THROUGH BOOKS
MORE WAYS THAT YOU ARE EXPRESSING YOUR VALUES MORE WAYS THAT YOU'RE BEING WHO YOU WANT TO BE
AND WE'VE KNOWN FOR YEARS THAT THE BODY IS LIGHT SENSITIVE FOR INSTANCE
AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE DIE MUCH FASTER AFTER BIOPSY
THE NIEMANN-PICK C ONE LIKE ONE TRANSPORTER
BACILLUS INFANTIS
HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUND MALE IS EXPECTED TO HAVE ONLY ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY CALORIES OF GLYCOGEN STORED IN HIS BODY IN HIS LIVER IN HIS MUSCLES AND A LITTLE BIT IN THE BLOODSTREAM
BUT WHAT THE SOUL IS
AFTER I PROCESSED IT ALL WAS SO VALUABLE TO ME
WE'RE SHIFTING ALSO AT THE LEVEL OF OUR GENES
YOU'LL KNOW WHERE THAT FITS IN YOUR PLACE OF MTOR AND AUTOPHAGY YOU'LL SAY OH
IT'S A COMBINATION OF NONPHARMACOLOGICAL SELF-EXPLORATION AND PSYCHOTHERAPY
THE AMOUNT OF REM SLEEP THAT WE HAD SHOT UP DRAMATICALLY
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THERE ARE SOME
I HATE MY BODY I'M TOO FAT
DIDN'T SEE ANY RESULTS
THAT PLACE OF INNER PEACE
AND I FIND IT'S A REALLY GREAT BIOMARKER OF INFLAMMATION
SO I KNOW THAT I FEEL BETTER WHEN I EAT FOOD THAT CLEAN
WHY AM I ALWAYS TIRED WHY AM I ALWAYS INJURED
SO WHAT WE ARE IS THE UNIQUE EXPRESSION OF THAT INFINITE ENERGY THAT'S THE POWER THAT WE HAVE INSIDE OF US
AND IF YOU GUYS
IT ACTUALLY LIKE FEELS GOOD TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE
AND THEN THAT HABIT CHANGED MY LIFE WHY BECAUSE WHEN I STARTED TO SMILE
THAT'S A BONUS
HOW DID ELVIS ACTUALLY SOUND SO I WENT ON YOUTUBE
AND THAT KETONE BODY IS TRANSPORTED TO OUR HEART AND BRAIN FOR BETTER FUNCTION
SO AS I'M IN HIGH SCHOOL SLEEP-DEPRIVED TRYING TO PAY ATTENTION
AND SOME PERCENTAGE OF US
BUT HERE'S THE DEAL MAN

BUT THAT'S JUST COMING IN THE MEANTIME BIOREACTORS THAT'S ALL LEGIT
SO ALL THESE THINGS IF YOU GO BACK TO THE PLANT COMPOUNDS YOU GET THE BENEFITS BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THE SAME TYPES OF DOWNSIDE
EVEN WITH AS MUCH WORK AS I'VE DONE ON MYSELF I KNOW THAT THERE ARE STILL AREAS THAT WE ALL HAVE THAT WE'RE JUST BLIND TO
SO YOU CAME OUT OF THIS AND YOU WERE GRATEFUL BECAUSE THINGS WORKED
AS WE DESCEND UNDERWATER
STEROIDS ARE NEEDED SOMETIMES FLUIDS I'VE GOT ALL THAT ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE MOST ABOUT OZONE IS THAT IT COMPLEMENTS EVERYTHING
AND YOU GUYS ARE ALL ABOUT THIS NO KILLING
THEIR ACADEMIC GRADES INCREASE
EXACTLY
BECAUSE GUESS WHAT I WILL BE GRATEFUL WHEN I SEE THAT FIVE STAR REVIEW
AND THAT CALM AND THAT PEACE IS NATURALLY WHO YOU ARE
I REALLY THINK THERE'S AN ETHICAL ARGUMENT FOR SAYING
BUT SERIOUSLY IF YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGHT OFF A VIRUS AND YOU'RE IN A MOLDY HOUSE
I USED OZONE THERAPY
I SAT ON A COUCH ONCE A WEEK FOR TWENTY YEARS AND NOT THAT MUCH CHANGED BUT I FELT BETTER FOR A LITTLE WHILE EACH WEEK
I FLY TO EUROPE WAKE UP I FEEL LIKE IT'S MORNING I DO WHAT I WANT TO DO
YOU TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I THINK LISTENERS WOULD LOVE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT YOU TALK ABOUT JOB DESIGN AND MEANINGFUL WORK
FIVE OF THOSE TEN FIFTY PERCENT WERE STARTED BY FIRST TIME ENTREPRENEURS IN THEIR EARLY TWENTY S
GET WORSE THAN AVERAGE RESULTS IT'S JUST YOU'VE GOT TO PLAY THE ODDS AND IN MY OPINION MY EXCLUSIVE NON-MEDICAL OPINION
THAT MADE MY SURVIVAL EASIER TOO BECAUSE I NO LONGER HAD TO WORRY ABOUT HER DIRECTLY
WELL THERE YOU GO RIGHT
YEAH I'M LIKE WOAH
THE DHEA GOES RIGHT ABOVE YOUR KIDNEYS IN THE BACK
USEFUL
OKAY FULL AGREEMENT WITH YOU THERE I KNEW WE WERE GOING TO FIND SOME COMMON GROUND HERE
THIS DOESN'T QUITE WORK SO WELL ANYMORE AFTER YOU TEAR A THIRD OF IT OFF RIGHT
TURNS OUT THEY ARE SIGNALING MOLECULES
BUT REALLY THE KEY IS WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT A LOT A LOT OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES OF ORGANISMS
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I HAVE FELT ALWAYS PLUGGED INTO SOMETHING BEYOND
AND EVEN MORE SO IN CONCENTRATED AREAS SUCH AS CHEESE
SHE WAS RUNNING THE POCKET RANCH WHERE WE WERE DOING A LOT OF TRAINING
HERE'S THE BIOCHEMICAL EXPLANATION GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW WHICH IS A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF WHAT WE WILL KNOW ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY
HUMAN BREAST MILK HAS FOUR TIMES LESS LEUCINE THAN COW'S MILK
RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND NUMBER THREE IS CARPE DIEM
NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS THAT THERE'S BEEN CONTRARY TO ANY SAFETY CONCERNS
AND TO DATE I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO'S TALKED ABOUT NEBULIZING HYDROGEN PEROXIDE I THINK YOU INVENTED IT
YOUR MIND GOES SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE INSTEAD OF THINKING ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU CAN'T THINK FAST ENOUGH SO YOU GO INTO THIS STATE WHERE YOU GET KIND OF EUPHORIA
IN DOG STUDIES AND MAMMAL STUDIES THEY'RE SEEING TWENTY FIVE PERCENT LONGER LIFE I DON'T KNOW
AND NOW YOU COULD HAVE COMMUNITY INSTANTLY
I THINK THAT'S ADMIRABLE AS LONG AS YOUR SIDE HUSTLE ISN'T THE SAME THING AS YOUR DAY HUSTLE
I ALWAYS HAVE CEREAL I ALWAYS HAVE CEREAL I GO WELL
IF I'VE DONE IT
HIS DAUGHTER GOT PREGNANT WHEN SHE WAS IN MEDICAL SCHOOL
AND ABOUT SIX PERCENT ON HEALTHCARE
WHAT ARE THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS I NEED TO KNOW WHAT WOULD YOU TELL THEM
AND I'M WORKING TO TRANSLATE THAT
I WANT TO KNOW WHO HAS THE BEST EXPERTISE ON EACH ISSUE AND LET THEM DRIVE THE CONVERSATION ON THAT ISSUE OR BETTER YET LET THEM FRAME THE CONVERSATION
AS AN INDIVIDUAL
YOU CHOOSE TO COMPLAIN
WE CAME UP AHEAD OF TIME WITH FIVE REASONS WHY PASTURE RAISED MEAT IS THE ONLY KIND OF MEAT YOU SHOULD EAT CAN YOU RUN ME THROUGH THOSE DO YOU HAVE THEM
THEY'RE STUCK AND THEY CAN'T LOSE THAT HUNDRED POUNDS OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT MATTERS MORE THAN WORKING HARD
AND I'M GOING TO NEGLECT MY OWN PRIORITIES AND WELL-BEING
BECAUSE COMMUNITY CAN BE FORMED SO CHEAPLY TODAY
BUT IT CAN TELL
I'VE BEEN TO THAT RESTAURANT MANY TIMES FOR ONE DOLLAR OYSTERS AT HAPPY HOUR
AND I RUN A COFFEE COMPANY
I LOVE BRINGING IN THE SCIENCE AND I LOVE ALSO BRINGING IN THE SPIRITUAL PART OF IT
GENES SO
YOUR SURVIVAL
THAT PRODUCES MORE THAN FORTY WATT OF LIGHT
IT HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN THE HIGHEST ONE
WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING WHAT IT IS ABOUT THOSE PARTICULAR LIFESTYLES AND DIETS
FAMILY SPIRITUALITY AND PHYSICALITY
YES EXACTLY
HAS THAT AFFECTED THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR LIFE NOW
HAVE THE DECADES OF DIVING CHANGED YOUR BIOLOGY HAVE YOU EXPERIENCED THINGS LIKE THE SPACE PROGRAM WE KNOW THAT CHANGES PEOPLE'S BIOLOGY
WE REACH OUT FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF HELP OR DIFFERENT KINDS OF SELF-ABUSE
AND THEN THE CAMP THAT SAYS NO ACTUALLY A SMALL PARTICLE IS AN INDEPENDENT PREDICTOR OF RISK AND THEREFORE HAS ATHEROSCLEROTIC PROPERTIES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO IT
BUT WILL IT BUY YOU LIFE
AND I HAD ZERO THYROID NOT ZERO BUT NEAR ZERO VERY VERY LOW THYROID AND VERY VERY LOW TESTOSTERONE LOWER THAN MY MOM WHEN I WAS TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX
WORK-LIFE INTEGRATION RESEARCHER SPEAKER AND NOW BEST-SELLING AUTHOR
BACK TO YOU
WHO'S HAVING TO THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX
DURING THIS TIME PROBABLY TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK
LOOK I HAVE A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THAT
AND NOT TAKE THINGS PERSONALLY BECAUSE WHEN THERE'S A TOXIC WORK ENVIRONMENT
BUT BEING REALLY SUCCESSFUL AT SOMETHING AND MAKING A LOT OF MONEY FROM SOMETHING IS ALWAYS VERY DIFFERENT THAN
NOW
WHEN THE REALITY IS YOU CAN'T KILL SOMETHING THAT'S NOT ALIVE RIGHT
AND I JUST WAS DETERMINED TO NOT LET THAT AFFECT ME AND NOT TAKE OVER MY LIFE ALRIGHT
I THINK YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS PERSPECTIVE AS IT IS IN ANYTHING IN LIFE
I TO LEARN HOW TO LEAD
A LOT OF ENTREPRENEURS I THINK HAVE THAT
AND BEN
THAT I BELIEVE YEAH THEY SERVE YOU THE REJECTS FOR ONE DOLLAR THEY SERVE YOU THE GOOD OYSTERS FOR THREE DOLLARS DOESN'T IT MAKE SENSE I CAN TELL YOU NEVER GOING TO AN ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI PLACE
THEMSELVES
HOW DO YOU GRASP THIS EVERY TIME YOU GO IN THE WATER
WHICH MEANS IN MY N EQUAL ONE STUDY
AND THAT LED YOU TO SAY I NEED THE KNOWLEDGE OF A PHARMACIST AND A NUTRITIONIST
SO LITERALLY WE ARE LIVING IN A SIMULATION AND EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE INTERACTING WITH IS WHO WE ARE
UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT A GENIUS BUT I STILL BELIEVE THAT OUR TEAM IS FILLED WITH GENIUSES AND I THINK THAT WE CAN SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS AND I THINK THAT WE CAN SOLVE THEM BY PREVENTION
WHATEVER
HOW MANY CELEBRITIES SHOULD BE IN A PROPOSAL
BUT WHAT THEY'VE ALSO REDUCED ARE THEIR IMMUNE CELLS THEIR STEM CELLS AND THEIR MUSCLE CELLS AND SO YOU CAN'T DO THESE THINGS ON A CONTINUAL BASIS
BECAUSE I PROMISE YOU IT'LL HAVE A HIGHER RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR YOU THAN EVEN THIS INTERVIEW
YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT USING WHAT WE HAVE
AND YOU'VE CHANGED CORTISOL AND A MULTIPLE OF HORMONES AND BACTERIA FOR THE WHOLE DAY
HOW DO YOU DO THAT
THIS PERSON'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE THAT OPEN TO WHAT I HAVE TO TELL THEM
EVEN THOUGH AT THE MOMENT IT MAY NOT JUST SUPER LIGHT ME UP SO WHAT I DO IS I PUT PEOPLE AROUND ME

BUT YOU'RE WHITE
YOU WORK WITH YOURSELF
YOU'RE GONNA PICK UP THE GAUNTLET AND ATTACK AGAIN
IT'S COMMUNICATING YOUR GALL BLADDER YOUR LIVER AND YOUR INTESTINES
SO SAME THING HERE YOU WANT FIFTY YEARS OF KNOWLEDGE AND SORTING OUT ALL THIS STUFF COMPRESSED INTO A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME
AND FOR OTHERS THEY MIGHT FIND THAT ACTUALLY LIKE LEBRON JAMES OR A TOM BRADY
YOU TALK ABOUT HOW YOUR LIFE LESSON FROM THIS IS LISTEN TO YOUR BODY AND YOUR INTUITION
YOU SHOULD TRY THIS ART OF LIVING THING THIS IS GOING BACK LIKE FIFTEEN YEARS
TELL ME ABOUT WHEN YOU'VE HAD THE BENDS
SAY IN AN AIRPORT
DON'T YOU WATCH THE NEWS
I DIDN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT IT
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T WRITE YET ANOTHER BOOK ABOUT JUICING YOGA AND JOGGING
OR HOW HEALTHY EGGS OR DAIRY IS FOR YOU
MILLIONTHS OF A GRAM ARE VERY EFFECTIVE
YOU WANT TO UNCROSS YOUR LEGS AND YOU WANT TO SIT LIKE YOU'RE ABOUT TO BINGE WATCH A NETFLIX SERIES
AND SO THIS IS WHERE THE COMMITMENT PART IS SO IMPORTANT
RIGHT BY SLAUGHTERING WHALES
THE LAST NUMBERS I'D SEEN WERE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ABOUT EIGHT TO TWELVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION HAVE DEFECTIVE OR SUBOPTIMALLY WORKING ATP BINDING CASSETTES
WHICH IS WHERE I MET HIM DURING THE COLLEGE DAYS
BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS DECREASE TRUANCY RATES DECREASE
AND THEY CAN TAKE IT AND GET A SELF-SCORE
OR
TODAY'S COOL FACT FOR THE DAY IS THAT RESEARCHERS JUST PUBLISHED A STUDY SHOWING A PARTICULAR GUT MICROBE CAN STOP SEVERE FLU INFECTIONS AT LEAST IF YOU'RE A MOUSE
THEN IT PREVENTS ANY ONE ORGANISM FROM GROWING OUT OF CONTROL
THEN THE NEXT DAY IS JUST GOING TO BE THAT MUCH HARDER
MAYBE THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING BECAUSE WE SEE THAT PEOPLE WHO DO TIME-RESTRICTED EATING
SEVEN DAYS OF YOUR LIFE AND ALL I WANT YOU TO DO IS CATCH YOURSELF WITH ANYTHING THAT YOU ARE SAYING THAT IS NEGATIVE OR DEROGATORY ABOUT YOURSELF
BETWEEN YOUR LEGS
THEN AS AN APPRENTICE TO A VEDIC MEDITATION TEACHER AND FINALLY BECAME A TEACHER HIMSELF YOU'LL FIND LIGHT WATKINS TRAVELING THE WORLD GIVING TALKS ON HAPPINESS INSPIRATION MEDITATION
ARE ALL EPIGENETIC FACTORS THAT LEAD TO HEALTH IF THE OPPOSITE A BAD DIET NO EXERCISE
AND I THINK FOR SOMETIMES
THAT MEANS I'M CALLING THE DIVE IT'S OVER
AS HUMANE AS POSSIBLE AND IT IS
YOU TALK ABOUT WAYS TO AVOID FATIGUE
AND A LOT OF THEM DECIDED TO USE IT THE ONCOLOGIST THAT I WORK WITH IS MOST INTERESTING
I HAVE SUBSTANTIAL CONCERNS ABOUT MISMATCH BETWEEN MITOCHONDRIAL DNA AND NUCLEAR DNA
SO IT WAS THIS BATTLE EMOTIONS AND FAST BREATHING AND FAST HEART RATE OR TAMP IT DOWN WITH A DEEP BREATH AND
WHEN WE'RE HUNGRY ACTUALLY IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT
THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO LEARN ONCE YOU GET INTO THE BIG BAD WORLD AND YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO LEARN THEM IF YOU CAN GET AROUND AND PUT YOURSELF INTO SITUATIONS WHERE YOU CAN REALLY APPRECIATE THE CHOICES AND PERFORMANCES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BREAKTHROUGH STARS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE
THEY WERE GETTING PHENOMENAL RESULTS WITH THIS KIND OF NO RULES TRAINING I WASN'T REALLY FOLLOWING THE PERFECT WORKOUT I WAS FOLLOWING WHAT EACH KID NEEDED
WERE YOU REALLY PISSED AT THE OTHER DIVER WHEN YOU CAME OUT
SPEND SIXTY SINEWY NONTHEORETICAL PENETRATING MINUTES WITH EACH ONE PLUMBING PROBING
OKAY I'M OPEN
GUESS HOW MUCH I WEIGHED AFTER ONE YEAR
THE ALTERED STATES OF BEING IS REALLY A PROFOUND STATE IT REALLY CONNECTS YOU TO YOUR SOURCE ENERGY AND TO YOUR
IF YOU WORK SEVENTY EIGHTY NINETY HOURS A WEEK
GO AHEAD
OTHERS THAT ARE MEASURING SPECIFIC AMINO ACIDS BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACID IN PARTICULAR
BUT SPIRITUAL REST WHAT IS THAT
CRAP
SHE ACTUALLY LEFT US WHEN I WAS ABOUT FIVE YEARS OLD
ANYTHING THAT PREDISPOSES YOU TO CANCER OR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
IF YOU DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING TODAY
SO I STARTED LOOKING AT WHAT IS IT THAT'S REALLY TIRED BECAUSE FATIGUE ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE PHYSICAL
RIGHT WE'RE CREATING A BIOLOGY OF NOT BEING ENOUGH AND THEN WE'RE CREATING A REALITY OF NOT BEING ENOUGH
OR THREE AND I DO THIS A LOT WITH RAPE SURVIVORS IS I'LL SAY
BUT
HOW THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE SOMEONE WHO IS A FAILURE
THESE THINGS THAT I'M SAYING THESE THINGS THAT I'M BEATING MYSELF UP ABOUT
THEY MEASURE IT ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEST THEY CAN DO TO REPLICATE HOW THE BODY WOULD RESPOND
MY CLINICAL SUPERVISOR WAS HEINZ KOHUT
IT'S GETTING BETTER THOUGH
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT
NOW LET'S REFRAME THE QUESTION
TELL ME HOW TO SUCCEED
THAT SAID
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DON'T TEACH YOU ABOUT SPEAKING IN FRONT OF AUDIENCES WHERE WAS THAT CLASS THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY DON'T TEACH YOU THE ELEMENTS OF SUCCESSFUL COSTUME FOR BUSINESS SUCCESS WHERE'S THAT CLASS
HE'S SPENT MORE THAN A DOZEN YEARS DEVELOPING A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED SUSTAINABLE LIVESTOCK FARM
IT STILL RENDERS THE ENTIRE THING INEFFECTIVE AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE NEGOTIATING PRICE
WE'LL ONLY LOOK AT THAT IN THE MOST HIGH RISK PATIENTS
WHEN YOU GO TO ONE OF OUR FARMS
BY ASKING PEOPLE AND SHOWING THEM WHAT YOU EAT CHANGES HOW YOU FEEL HOW LONG YOU'LL LIVE HOW YOU SHOW UP IN THE WORLD WHETHER YOU'RE A NICE PERSON OR A CRANKY PERSON
WHY DO WE NEED THE ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORK
NOW THAT IS A BIZARRE THING TO HAVE AS A TOP SELLER
YOU LOSE THE BIODIVERSITY YOU LOSE THE SOIL MICROBES
YOU'RE ALREADY WORKING ON THIS STUFF YOU PROBABLY JUST AREN'T DOING IT VERY WELL AND SO LEARN FROM SOMEONE WHO'S DONE IT BEFORE
REALLY CHALLENGE YOURSELF TO KNOW YOURSELF
THEN A FRIEND OF MINE CAME WITH HER DAUGHTER
YOU DON'T KNOW AND I ACTUALLY USE THE OURA RING AS MY DATA SET SAY WHAT DOES THIS DO AND NOW WE'VE DONE SOME EEG STUDIES AND WE'VE GOT SOME OTHER DATA THAT SUPPORTS
WE'RE GOING TO BE BETTER THAN AVERAGE
OVERLAPPING WITH THIS
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO OPTIMIZE FOR YOUR LEARNING AND MEMORY
TO BURN KETONES WHEN THEY'RE PRESENT
IT COULD BE GOING OUT OF YOUR WAY TO RECOGNIZE SOMEBODY WHOSE WORK HAS GONE UNNOTICED
AND MICE EAT THAT FOOD WITHIN THREE TO FOUR HOURS EVERY SINGLE DAY
IT'S ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS
WHAT IS AN MTP WHAT IS A MOONSHOT
THE MORE YOU REFLECT ON THIS YOU'LL IDENTIFY CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS THAT BEST SELF
SO PART OF YOUR ANTI-AGING STRATEGY SHOULD BE LEAVING A REVIEW FOR THE SWITCH IT'S JUST SCIENCE RIGHT OKAY
AND
IF SOMEONE WERE TO SLEEP SIX HOURS
AND CUT HIM
AND IF YOU WANNA KNOW SOMETHING YOU CAN FOR FREE
BUT I LOSE SOMEHOW CONFIDENCE JUST BEFORE THE COMPLETION
I THINK THE QUESTION IS DO YOU FEEL LUCKY
SURE YOUR HEART WANTS TO RACE YOUR BREATHING WANTS TO RAMP UP
SO IT'S ABOUT APPRECIATING WHAT PROGRESS YOU'RE MAKING AND NOT JUDGING THE PROGRESS
YOU MENTIONED THE LIVER QUITE A LOT IN THERE
BUT MOST PEOPLE HAVE SOME CONNECTION TO THAT THAT THEY UNDERSTAND KIND OF INTRINSICALLY WHETHER THEY'RE PRACTICING ANY SPECIFIC RELIGION OR NOT

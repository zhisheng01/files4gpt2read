I MIGHT AS WELL WORK ON THIS I DON'T HAVE TO COMMUTE
IT'S WHAT I CALL YOUR OWN PERSONAL ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS
ACCUMULATING MORE ESTROGEN THAN I SHOULD BE IN MY BODY AM I ELIMINATING IT FAST ENOUGH
WHERE'S THAT CLASS
I GOT FORTY POUNDS OF RAW BUTTER ON MY BOAT HE GOES
WHICH ARE LIKE GENES
A MID-MORNING SNACK LUNCH A MID-AFTERNOON SNACK
I'M MOVING OUT TO HOLLYWOOD TO START GOING ON AUDITIONS AND WRITING SCREENPLAYS AND TRYING TO DISCOVER WHO AM I
IS THAT
IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO WORK OUT FOR AN HOUR
ALMOST EVERY ORGAN HAS ITS OWN CLOCK
SECOND WOULD BE KNOWING WHO YOU'RE ABOUT
WELCOME TO THE SHOW THANK YOU DAVE SUCH A PLEASURE TO BE HERE
THE NATURAL IMMUNE RESPONSE IT GETS RED HOT TENDER AND SWOLLEN
CREATIVITY AND INTEGRITY
A WAR CORRESPONDENT LARA LOGAN
SO YOU ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE ALIVE IF YOU'RE MORE POSITIVE AND HAPPY YOU'VE SEEN THE MOVIE GRUMPY OLD MEN RIGHT
AND I SORT OF NEVER WANNA SEE THEIR CHOLESTEROL SYNTHESIS SUPPRESSED BELOW A CERTAIN LEVEL WHICH WE CAN MEASURE
IF YOU CAN DO SOMETHING THAT GETS YOU TWENTY DOLLARS
I SLEPT LIKE A BABY
AND IT DOES SEEM THAT FROM SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT I'VE READ
THREE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF ORB-WEAVERS MAY HAVE THE SHORTEST NATURAL CIRCADIAN RHYTHM DISCOVERED IN ANY ANIMALS SO FAR AT LEAST ACCORDING TO RESEARCHERS AT EAST TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY
AND SO WHAT WE'VE FOUND IS WITH A RING FORM FACTOR
AS SOON AS IT KICKS OVER TO THE PNEUMONIA BACTERIA TYPE OF INFECTION THEN CUTTING THE CARBS AND BEING JUST IN KETOSIS WOULD BE THE BEST STRATEGY
AND I FOUND THAT NOT EATING A TON OF ALMONDS IS A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE I WAS GETTING INFLAMMATION FROM THE OXALATES AND THE LECTINS
MORE IMPORTANTLY WE CAN SEE WHERE THESE TRACTS ARE BROKEN WHEN YOU HAD YOUR CONCUSSION
I'VE NOTICED
A GREAT MAJORITY OF CONCUSSIONS LEAST THAT I'VE OBSERVED
YOU'RE COMPROMISING THE BENEFITS YOU CAN POTENTIALLY GET THROUGH ANY FORM OF FASTING APPROACH
NOW YOU'D HAD SOME STUFF GOING ON LIKE YOU WENT TO THE DOCTOR
BUT THE REAL ANSWER THERE IS I'D LIKE TO DIE AT A TIME AND BY A METHOD OF MY CHOOSING
IT'S MOSTLY SOLVED
WHEN A YOUNG PERSON HAS AN EXPERIENCE LIKE THAT IT SLAMS THE DOOR IN THEIR FACE NEVER TO BE OPENED AGAIN IN MANY WAYS
MORE FREQUENTLY FOR LONGER DURATION
AND THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THAT ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL WAYS TO DO THAT IS TO BECOME AWARE OF OUR BREATH IN EVERY MOMENT
AND THEY'RE HAPPY
YOU JUST
DON'T BE AFRAID TO REST
PAIN IN THE NECK HEAD
WHAT'S UP WITH THIS HOW COME I KEEP LANDING IN THIS PLACE OF FEELING LIKE THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE
ELEVATED CORTISOL LEADS TO ESTROGEN DOMINANCE
THEN THE NEXT THING IS WHAT'S CALLED SELF-AGENCY
SO FAR
NOW HERE'S WHERE IT
AND IF THEY WANT MY HELP OR THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO CALL ME
BUT I THINK PEOPLE REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE BASICS OF WHAT TURNS THIS SWITCH OFF AND ON
DOES GARY VEE HAVE A PRICE ON YOUR HEAD
ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING
I'VE DRANK AYAHUASCA OVER A HUNDRED TIMES
AND IT TOTALLY CHANGED HIS BRAIN HE'S LIKE RAVES ABOUT IT
NOW YOU TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THOUGH THAT I HAVEN'T HEARD OTHERS TALK ABOUT IN THE SAME WAY
BUT IT'S ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE DAY
AND SO FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS I'M GONNA BE FOR THREE DAYS ONSTAGE
SO ROLAND
THEN YOU NEED TO TAKE MY NUMBER
I'VE BEEN WITH PEOPLE ON DIVES WHERE I'VE HAD A REALLY GOOD MENTAL FRAMEWORK AROUND THE DIVE I'VE HAD A VERY POSITIVE DIVE IT'S GONE WELL
BLEEDING IN YOUR BRAIN AND
AND I KNOW BECAUSE WE SEE THEM EVERY DAY
WE ARE AT A TURNING POINT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DISEASE
AND FOR ME IT'S LIKE OKAY MY READINESS SCORE IS LOW MY SLEEP SCORE IS LOW TODAY IS NOT A GOOD DAY FOR ME TO EXERCISE BECAUSE I'M ACTUALLY PROBABLY GONNA DO MORE DAMAGE
ALMOST ALWAYS FROM A LIPID
AND WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY
THAT A REALLY REALLY WELL DONE FAMILY HISTORY PROVIDES FAR GREATER INSIGHT INTO THE GENETIC RISKS THAT ARE PREDISPOSING PEOPLE TO DEATH THAN A WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCE BUT THE POINT IS ONCE YOU FINISH DOING A COMPLETE RISK ASSESSMENT
I WOULD DO MY SESSIONS AND I WOULD MEDITATE AND THE NEXT DAY I WAS SEEING SIX SEVEN CLIENTS
AND REALLY A LOT IN THE HEALTHCARE SPACE
I HAVE YET TO FIND ANY DATA ABOUT WHAT SOLUBLE FIBER DOES TO AUTOPHAGY OR MTOR OR PREBIOTICS
YET MONSANTO STILL CLAIMS THAT IT HAS NO EFFECT ON HUMAN HEALTH DESPITE THE FACT THAT OUR HEALTH IS INTEGRALLY TIED TO SOIL MICROBES I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO THAT UNLESS YOU'RE JUST EVIL BUT THAT'S JUST ME
MIGHT NOT BE AS RELEVANT FOR WHERE WE ARE TODAY
I DON'T KNOW THAT MOST PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS
CATAPULT ELEVATE ACCELERATE THEM TO SO MANY DIFFERENT
BUT THEN
I REALIZED THAT ANYTHING I WANT TO DO IS POSSIBLE
AND HE WORKS WITH REVEREND MICHAEL BECKWITH AS WELL SO THIS IS ONE OF TODAY'S MODERN LEADERS IN PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT AND PANACHE'S NEW BOOK IS CALLED YOU ARE ENOUGH REVEALING THE SOUL TO DISCOVER YOUR POWER POTENTIAL AND POSSIBILITY
BOTH PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY
THERE'S A WAY TO DO IT
JUST SAY THANKS IT'S EASIER THAN LEAVING A TIP FOR AN UBER DRIVER
WHEN I WAS IN GRADUATE SCHOOL I TRAINED TWICE A WEEK
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO YOURSELF WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT PEOPLE
IF YOU JUST SPEAK LOUDER THAT WILL HELP YOU TO COMMUNICATE WAY WAY WAY MORE EFFECTIVELY AND IT HAS VERY INTERESTING ROOTS IN THE PSYCHOLOGY THAT GOES INTO SPEAKING LOUDER
ACROSS MANY STATES
THIS WAS BEFORE THEY SPLIT
YOU JUST AREN'T USING SUGAR EFFECTIVELY AND YOUR CELLS ARE STARVING FOR ENERGY
AND I REMEMBER I WAS LITERALLY BOUNCING BACK AND FORTH ALL THE TIME I'D BE LIKE OKAY WORK MODE GRIND
NOW
HE HAD INTERVIEWED WITH ME FOR TWO YEARS PRIOR DAVE
I'M NOT IN ANY PAIN
AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE REST OF US CAN LEARN FROM THEM AND ONE OF THOSE WORKPLACES WAS A TOMATO PASTE PLANT CALLED MORNING STAR WHERE THEY'VE OPERATED SUCCESSFULLY FOR THREE DECADES
I'VE TRIED REALLY HARD IN THIS BOOK TO MAKE IT SIMPLE
I'M NOT SURE PANACHE
IF YOU BELIEVE YOU'RE A MEAT ROBOT AND YOU REALLY HOLD ON TO THAT BELIEF YOU PROBABLY WON'T LIKE THE INTERVIEW TODAY
YOU PROBABLY LOSE SOME OF THOSE CALORIES IN THE METABOLISM OF IT BUT
ADAM WELCOME TO THE SHOW THANK YOU IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE DAVE ALL RIGHT YOU BECAME A TENURED PROFESSOR AT WHARTON WHILE STILL IN YOUR TWENTY S
EXACTLY
EVERYBODY HAS A CHOICE AT EVERY MOMENT
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON HAPPINESS
AND SO MEDITATION IS THE ULTIMATE REST HACK YOU CAN GET
YOUR THUMB AND YOUR INDEX FINGER COME TOGETHER AND THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A PART OF THE LOOK
I SAY
AND I'M LIKE MR SMITHERS
WITH A VISION OF CREATING A FARMING BUSINESS THAT'S GOOD FOR ANIMALS

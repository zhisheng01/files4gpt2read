SOCIAL
MORE TENSION OKAY
AND IT HAPPENS TO MEN IF NOBODY'S WATCHING I HAVE TWO MORE BIG QUESTIONS FOR YOU BEFORE WE GET TO THE END OF THE INTERVIEW ONE IS I'M A GUY
AND I NOTICED IT WITH INJURIES ON DIFFERENT TRICKS
I DON'T KNOW
WE TRY TO TAKE THE BEST OF EMOTIONAL GROWTH AND PUT IT ON
RIGHT
I DON'T HAVE TO STAY IN ENERGY THAT IS LOW VIBRATION I WANT TO STAY AROUND PEOPLE WHO ARE LIT
I DON'T THINK SHE WAS RUDE
GOING BACK THROUGH EXAMPLES OF PRESIDENTIAL CORRUPTION AND
LOOK YOU'RE NOT HERE TO MEET SOMEONE ELSE'S EXPECTATIONS
WHAT SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING IS THAT THAT HOOK IS CAUSED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY SICK
SECOND
IF YOU COULDN'T SPEAK
BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO TAKE THE TIME THAT WE NEED THAT'S WHY SELF-LOVE IS THE GREATEST LOVE THAT YOU CAN GIVE YOURSELF
SHE COULD RESPOND WITH WHY ARE YOU MAD AT ME
BECAUSE THE CHALLENGE IS
WHICH
SO YOU TALK ABOUT SOMETHING VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO ME ABOUT
MUST MEAN THAT ALL OF THEM HAVE A UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO MAKE AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DISCOVERING THERE WAS ALSO THE ARGUMENT THAT MOTHER NATURE DIDN'T REALLY EVOLVE US TO LIVE IN THE WORLD WHERE
AND I'LL ACTUALLY READ IT SO I'LL KNOW WHAT YOU THOUGHT SO TELL ME WHAT YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THE BOOK GO TO AMAZON LEAVE A REVIEW
EATING STRANGE FORMS OF CACTUS MUSHROOMS AYAHUASCA
YOU PICK SOME WORD THAT IS MEANINGFUL TO YOU AND EVERY TIME YOU TRY TO THINK ABOUT WORK YOU BRING YOURSELF BACK TO THAT ONE WORD
THAT'S BACTERIA THEY ARE YES YES
THE PURPOSE OF ANGER IS TO ATTACK A THREAT
I SPENT NINE YEARS ON THE COUCH
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK HERE
STOP FOCUSING ON WHAT YOU DON'T WANT IN YOUR LIFE PEOPLE
LISTEN
THE XPRIZE FOUNDATION SEES HUNDREDS OF IDEAS
BUT YOUR WORK MUST HAVE PURPOSE
I THINK IT IS URGENT
YOU WILL LITERALLY START SEEING MORE AND MORE
WE STARTED DEVELOPING THIS PROGRAM ALMOST ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO
I THINK WHEN WE'RE WHOLE AND WE'RE FULL
I'M REALLY HAPPY TO HAVE A FRIEND AND FORMER GUEST OF BULLETPROOF RADIO BACK ON THE SHOW
THEN IT WOULD BEHOOVE ANYONE I THINK
I HAVEN'T DONE ALL THE BLOOD SUGAR TESTS AND ALL THAT STUFF BUT THE DEAL IS DO YOU HAVE THE ENERGY THAT YOU NORMALLY WOULD HAVE ANYWHERE YOU GO
IT'S THE FIRST THING IS GONNA BE METABOLISM
AND THE SURGEON WENT IN AND DID A SCAN BEFORE THEY WERE GONNA BOOK HIM FOR SURGERY AND WAS LIKE AH
THEN THINGS START TO CHANGE OR IF THEY TELL ME I DON'T HAVE TIME I GO TO THE DELI
AND THEN THAT BECOMES OUR SUBCONSCIOUS BELIEF SYSTEM AND OUR SUBCONSCIOUS BELIEF SYSTEM ACTUALLY CREATES OUR REALITY
YOU'VE GOT TO WORK
USUALLY YOU BREAK IT WITH A SMALL MEAL
IT'S OUR BRAIN AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE BRAIN WE EVOLVE ON THE SAVANNA'S OF AFRICA HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO BACK THEN IF YOU MISSED A PIECE OF NEGATIVE NEWS
IT'S REALLY ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO TAP IN
THERE USED TO BE NO TERMS I ALWAYS SAY BACK WHEN YOU AND I WERE YOUNG THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS LITTLE LEAGUERS ELBOW OR TENNIS ELBOW
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE BUILT HERE IS AN AMAZING BOOK AND READING THE RIGHT
THERE'S THE ONE THAT BELONGS TO THE PLANET ALSO
ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE IN JAIL
LIKE OH IF IT HAPPENS THREE TIMES IT'S DEFINITELY A PATTERN
CONFINEMENT INDUSTRIAL LIVESTOCK FARMING
IF THE LIVER IS SLUGGISH AND IT'S NOT PRIME
THIS IS VALUABLE IN KNOWING THAT MTOR CONTROLS ALL OF YOUR CELL PROLIFERATION
YOU CAN TALK TO ORGANS IN OTHER PEOPLE'S BODIES
DUDE WHY DO YOU SPEND SO MUCH TIME ON THE TREADMILL AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS
ALL RIGHT GUYS
ONE OF THOSE FOUR TYPES
LIKE YOU SAID OBESITY TO ABUSE ABANDONMENT
PEOPLE OUGHT TO BE DOING THIS PROBABLY ANYWAY DURING A FLU SEASON AND THAT WOULD BE
THAT'S NOT WHY I TAKE IT AND THAT'S NOT WHY I WENT OUT TO GET IT
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU'LL LIVE
SO I'M ASSUMING THE YEAST YOU HAD WAS CANDIDA
BUT IT'S NOT NORMAL NOT TO REGROW ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED HAIRS A DAY
AND TO CAUSE CELLULAR GROWTH AND PROTEIN PRODUCTION
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT VACCINES
SO I'M SAYING MAYBE THAT KIND OF REST IS LACKING IN EVERYONE YOU LIVE IN BIG CITY HOW WOULD YOU EVER GET THIS
IN THE FACE OF HYPOXIA THE HUMAN BODY DOES NOT ALWAYS TRIGGER TO BREATHE AGAIN
NOW I'M NOT TRYING TO BELITTLE DIET AND EXERCISE THEY ARE FUNDAMENTAL AND IT'S ALL INTERACTING OF COURSE NONE OF THESE SIT IN ISOLATION
AND TWO-THIRDS OF FARMLAND IN THE US IS SET TO TRANSITION TO NEW OWNERS IN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS
I'M NOT REALLY MAKING ANY PROGRESS I'M NOT BUILDING MUSCLE
AND AS I SAID BEFORE HUNKER DOWN AND ACTUALLY PRODUCE SOME OF THE AMINO ACIDS AND THINGS THAT WE NEED FROM INSIDE OUR CELL
THAT SOMETHING COULD NOT BE DONE
THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD NEVER SAY IF YOU WANT TO MAKE MORE MONEY IS LET ME THINK ABOUT IT
HALFWAY THERE
NOW IF YOU
IT IS RELAXING TO JUST BE LIKE YEAH
AND I WAS BEGINNING TO SEE THROUGH ALL OF THE LAYERS OF SEPARATION
NO I DON'T KNOW HOW TO CURE IT
MORTALITY RISK ON THE VERTICAL
AN ORGANIC
ANY TIME NOW
ONE OF THE BEST WAYS THAT WE HAVE TO SELECTIVELY REMOVE YOUR DEEP SLEEP IS TO PLAY AUDITORY TONES TO YOU
MAYBE YOUR GOLF GAME MAYBE YOUR TENNIS GAME
AND WE ALL KNOW BY NOW IF YOU'VE LISTENED TO EVEN JUST A FEW EPISODES THAT GRATITUDE MAKES YOU LIVE LONGER
WE'VE ALL BEEN BROKENHEARTED WE'VE ALL LOST TO SOME DEGREE RIGHT
IT'S ABOUT RESILIENCE
LOOKED IN THE POSTERIOR TEMPORAL LOBE WITH THE FELLOW WHO COULDN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING
AND SHE SAW SOMETHING IN ME THAT I COULDN'T HAVE SEEN IN MYSELF
I PICKED THIS UP WHEN I WAS ABOUT THIRTY I LEARNED THAT AND I ACTUALLY STARTED CRYING AT THE TIME BECAUSE
I CAN ASK YOUR BREATH I CAN ASK ANY OTHER ENERGY SOURCE TO COMMUNICATE TO YOUR FEET AND THEN YOUR FEET I CAN HAVE THEM COMMUNICATE TO YOUR HANDS
SO YOU GOT TO STOP AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SMOKING POT YOU GOT TO STOP THAT TOO YOU CAN EAT IT INSTEAD VAPING PROBABLY ISN'T A GOOD IDEA
BECAUSE IT'S THAT MUCH OF A LIFE SAVER
MAYBE THE NEXT DAY IS FORTY FIVE MINUTES OF JUST LIGHT SCALE WORK
HER HEART RATE WOULD GET UP SHE DIDN'T FEEL GOOD BLAH BLAH BLAH
AND THAT NIGHT WHEN I GOT BACK AND I GOT HOME
AND IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED THE PATHWAY I HAVE A SLIDE LIKE THAT THAT I USE
LOTS OF THINGS HAPPEN ON DAY TWELVE
WHY IS GRASS-FED IMPORTANT FOR OUR SOIL AND OUR ENVIRONMENT
ACCORDING TO THE BULLETPROOF DAVE ASPREY PERSPECTIVE PEOPLE WHO SLEEP MORE THAN EIGHT HOURS A NIGHT DIE MORE THAN PEOPLE WHO SLEEP SIX AND A HALF HOURS A NIGHT

PACK YOUR OWN LUNCH
THE STEM CELLS IN YOUR SKIN
SO IT KIND OF MATCHES THE INDUSTRIAL FOOD SYSTEMS ETHOS OF LET'S GET SOMETHING TO THE CONSUMER THAT LOOKS LIKE A TOMATO
HOW MUCH COULD YOU OFFSET A KNOWN DRIVER OF DECLINE BY JUST HAVING MORE EXPERIENCE WITH THE GAME SO THE EXPERIMENT WAS BASICALLY GETTING A WHOLE BUNCH OF THE ANALYSTS TOGETHER TO TAKE THE TEST
ALL RIGHT
AND A VIRUS ISN'T ALIVE
BUT IF I'M NEVER IN KETOSIS MY LIFE ABSOLUTELY SUCKS
YOU CAN CERTAINLY FIND LOTS OF PROCESSED FOODS THAT ARE VEGAN IT DOESN'T MAKE IT HEALTHY
AND THEN ENSURING THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT TRAINING THE RIGHT PERSONNEL THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT AND REDUNDANCY WITH ME
DRANK
AND SO
WITH A PRESCRIPTION
HOW HAS THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS
DEFINE SOUL BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT SOUL A LOT
I DIDN'T MAKE A CHOICE I'M GOING TO START WORKING OUT
AND I ALSO RECOMMEND THINGS LIKE SONIC SLEEP
IF YOUR SCAB EVER CAME OFF EARLY YOU'D SEE THIS BRIGHT RED BUBBLING RED STUFF UNDERNEATH THE SCAB
SO YOU JUST REFRAME THOSE DECISIONS
I DO THINK EVEN MORE DATA
YOU ACTUALLY WROTE A BOOK CALLED ORIGINALS HOW NON-CONFORMISTS MOVE THE WORLD
AND HE ENDED UP WITH RETROGRADE AMNESIA
BUT
CHANCES ARE IT'S VERY STABLE
AND I'M NOT SURE THAT
TWO IT IS NOT CLEAR IF THESE FINDINGS ARE ASSOCIATIVE OR CAUSATIVE TO THE THINGS WE CARE ABOUT
YOU KNOW
THE KETO ZONE FOR ME
BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET VERY MANY RESULTS THEY TAKE A LONG TIME AND IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME IT TAKES A LOT OF ENERGY
AND SO FOR ME WHEN I STARTED LOOKING AT THIS WHOLE CONCEPT OF REST
I'M DISCOVERING THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THAT HIGH-RISK CATEGORY ESPECIALLY PEOPLE THAT I'VE BEEN CONNECTING WITH
THEN YOU CAN FIRST BECAUSE IT'S THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO DO
SO THAT'S WHAT CAUSES A FAILURE TO SELF-DEVELOPMENT
HAPPINESS
GLOBAL PANDEMIC
SO YEAH I GRADUATED COLLEGE I DID STUDY ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
BUT THE THING THAT REALLY WAS ASTOUNDING WAS WHEN I CAME BACK FROM TIBET
WE WENT TO CHINA
THAT THEY'RE CONSIDERED SACRED
BUT
AND THIS AFFECTS WOMEN I THINK MAYBE AT LEAST AS MUCH AS MEN IN FACT WOMEN GET MORE HASHIMOTO'S THAN MEN
ONCE THEY GET THAT AND THEY CAN HOLD IT MOST OF THE TIME
I TALK EVERY SINGLE DAY
LOOKING INCREDIBLY COOL WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT THE DELTA BRAINWAVES OF AUDIENCE MEMBERS WHO WATCHED THE MUSIC LIVE WERE MORE SYNCHRONIZED THAN PEOPLE IN THE OTHER TWO GROUPS
HOW OLD WERE YOU
AM I RIGHT
I HAD A TEACHER WHO WAS
I'M OKAY
FOR PEOPLE AS THEY ARE THAT'S PART OF UNCONDITIONAL LOVE
FURTHERMORE IT DELAYED THE PEAK OF THAT MELATONIN
HOWEVER THESE GUYS DID HACK IT NOW WE KNOW THAT CREATIVITY IS A DYNAMIC STATE THAT CHANGES QUICKLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL
MY GUESS IS IT'S PROBABLY NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL IF IT ACTUALLY IS ON YOUR SKIN AND NOT IN YOUR EYES BUT FROM THE WORK OF SATCHIN PANDA
WHAT'S YOUR ADVICE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SITTING THERE SAYING I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M DOING WHAT MAKES ME HAPPY BUT I KIND OF LIKE TO EAT
NOW TODAY'S GUEST IS FOUNDER OF THE UNDERGROUND STRENGTH GYM
YOU BECAME INTERESTED IN THIS LIMITLESS LIVING BECAUSE YOU SORT OF DID THE OPPOSITE OF THAT
MOST INDEPENDENT SENSE OF SELF
AND WAY LESS TESTOSTERONE TOO I REALLY DID IT WAS KIND OF EMBARRASSING
AND I DID IT ON THE FLY IT'S SHORT AND THIS IS WHAT I WOULD DO IF I WAS LOOKING AT HACKING INTERLEUKIN SIX
WHY BOTHER TO TRY
YOU KNOW WHAT
BUT THEY HAVEN'T REALLY PUT THEIR HOUSE IN ORDER YET
I REALLY DO
THAT DROPPED ACCIDENT RATES BY TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT I THINK
WE'VE GOT AT LEAST AN HOUR
OPEN A CLEAN SHEET OF PAPER AND SEE THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY
THE GOAL IS CAN YOU GENERATE EVEN THAT EXTRA TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS ABOVE BUSINESS AS USUAL
BUT THE AMOUNT OF PUFAS IN GENERAL
THAT'S CALLED DISMISSING ATTACHMENT IN ADULTS
I THINK ALL OF THESE THINGS FROM AN ENGINEERING STANDPOINT ARE PLAUSIBLE
YOU HAVE TO BE YOU
I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE ALL THAT I'VE EARNED BUT I'M ABSOLUTELY WILLING TO SPEND A FEW MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE IT WON'T CHANGE MY LIFE ONE BIT
YEAH
THE BIGGEST PART OF OUR ECONOMY TOO
SO I'LL JUST SAY A COUPLE THINGS
THE PURPOSE OF AN EMOTION A FEELING A SENSATION OR A THOUGHT IS A CALL FOR ACTION THE PURPOSE OF FEAR IS TO ESCAPE A THREAT
WHAT I SAY MILESTONES IN CIRCADIAN RHYTHM RESEARCH OR HEALTH RESEARCH
ALL OF THE DECREASE IN INFLAMMATION
AND HE SAID SOMETHING SO PROFOUND
SOME OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE AREAS YOU NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT MASSIVELY AFFECT YOUR PERFORMANCE
THERE WERE SECTIONS WHERE I TALKED ABOUT THESE IN THE CONTEXT OF DIET
DO YOU THINK
SUFISM AND SO ON
WOULD YOU DO ME THE SERVICE OF LETTING PEOPLE KNOW THANK YOU
DISRUPTIVE INDIVIDUALS AND LOU IS ONE OF THOSE
AND NO ONE ELSE LIVES IN YOUR HOUSE
WHY
THERE'S A CARDIOLOGIST NAMED JOHN COOKE AT STANFORD WHO HE WAS AT STANFORD WHEN HE DISCOVERED THIS
THE TESTOSTERONE GOES RIGHT ON YOUR FEMORAL ARTERY
SO IF YOU'RE DOING HIMALAYAN SALT THE WAY I RECOMMEND YOU NEED TO BE ON AN IODINE SUPPLEMENT
OR SHOULD WE TAKE THAT KNOWLEDGE AND SAY OKAY
THIS IS JUST AN AUTOMATIC PART OF MY BRAIN THAT IS UNDISCIPLINED AND NOT TRAINED
BUT ARE WE PAYING AS MUCH ATTENTION AS TO THE PEOPLE WE'RE SURROUNDING OURSELVES BY AND THE THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS WE'RE HAVING AS A RESULT OF THOSE INTERACTIONS
DO YOU DO SOMETHING IF YOU'RE JUST ONE ON ONE WITH SOMEONE
I WAS VERY VERY IMPRESSED
WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT LONGER FAST IN ANIMALS BECAUSE ANIMALS DON'T LIKE THIS VERY LONG FAST
SO IT'S NOT UP TO ME TO DECIDE WHAT IS IMPORTANT WHAT IS IMPORTANT
AND THEN
OH THAT'S NOT MY CRAP
SO
AND WE SHUT IT DOWN
SO WHAT'S GOING ON THERE

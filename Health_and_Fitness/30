I GET YELLED AT OR HIT OR WHATEVER THAT ALSO
MAYBE SIX MONTHS FROM NOW AND DECIDE TO DO THAT OR YOU COULD DO WHAT I DO AS A BIOHACKER AND SAY WELL GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW WHAT IS THE MOST LOGICAL WAY THAT I CAN BE NOT AVERAGE
TALKING ABOUT WHAT ARE THOSE TECHNOLOGIES GOING FROM DECEPTIVE TO DISRUPTIVE
WHY ARE THEY LAUGHING
EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO
AND THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU'RE IN AN ANABOLIC STATE
WHO'S A MODEL IN HIS LATE TWENTY S
SOMETHING THAT
EVEN FOR THAT SMALL SALAD
WHAT'S THE WEAKEST ORGAN IN MY BODY RIGHT NOW
PASSION
AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN METFORMIN AND GLUCOPHAGE IS A
THREE COLORFUL MEALS A DAY
I HAVE SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME THAT IS ETERNAL THAT'S INFINITE
IF YOU CAN BURN FAT IN THE FORM OF KETONES THERE'S MORE ELECTRONS AVAILABLE SO IT'S EASIER BUT TRADITIONAL SCIENCE SAYS OH
BUT
PH D WHO'S A LEADING EXPERT IN CIRCADIAN RHYTHM AND A PROFESSOR AT THE SALK INSTITUTE IN SAN DIEGO
YOU WOULD HAVE TO JOIN A GROUP THAT'S MEETING REGULARLY
AND WHEN I CHANGED OUT THE BUTTERS ONLY GRASS-FED BUTTER
AND WHEN SHE STARTED HER FIRST COMPANY LIKE TWENTY YEARS AGO SHE HIRED A NANNY
FIFTY BODY WEIGHT SQUATS IN A ROW FORTY PUSH UPS IN ARROW FULL RANGE OF MOTION AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO DO A WORKOUT
YOU'RE BREAKING A CHAIN OF INFORMATION
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SHARE THE DETAILS THAT'S FINE
THEN EIGHT AND NINE HAPPENED
WHICH IS BIZARRE
THERE'S A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE OUT THERE
IT IS NONE OTHER THAN MARK SISSON
NOW LET IT GO RELAX
WHEN I READ ABUNDANCE OR BOLD YOUR LAST TWO BOOKS
WHICH JUST BLEW ME AWAY
IT'S QUITE THE OPPOSITE WE'RE NOW FINDING THAT THAT TYPE OF SLEEP IS PACKED FULL OF THINGS THAT WE CALLED SLEEP SPINDLES WHICH ARE THESE SHORT BURSTS OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY THAT HAPPEN FOR ABOUT A SECOND OR A SECOND-AND-A-HALF
NUMBER ONE
TWO PUSH UPS BECAME THREE BECAME FOUR TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY I REMEMBER ONCE I WAS ABLE TO DO MORE THAN TWENTY PUSH UPS SIMPLY BY ADDING ONE A DAY I STARTED BEATING KIDS IN ARM WRESTLING
IT'S POSSIBLE THERE'S A GENETIC THING GOING ON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT THE MORE LIKELY THING IS YOU'RE SICK AND YOU DON'T KNOW IT
NOT SO MUCH WOMEN MAKE GROWTH HORMONE IN THEIR LIVER IF THEY HAVE ENOUGH ESTROGEN
WHICH IS SHOCKING
I GOT GLUCOSE AND YOU'RE SITTING THERE GOING WHY CAN'T I GO BACK TO SLEEP IT'S BECAUSE YOU JUST GOT STRESS HORMONES TO STABILIZE YOUR BLOOD SUGAR
AM I CONTROLLING MY LIGHT EXPOSURE
WE NEED TO STOP REPRODUCING STOP GROWING THE CELL
AND THIS IS THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD
IT LOOKS UNCONSCIOUS FOR MOST PEOPLE
THE HABIT OF ME SMILING CREATED A SHIFT AND A CHANGE THAT WAS SO BIG THAT IT SHIFTED EVERYTHING IN MY ENVIRONMENT
THIS IS HOW YOU CAN KNOW THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THEY'RE TELLING YOU TO QUIET YOUR MIND
WE KNOW IT'S MORE POWERFUL MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN THAT
FASCINATING STUFF
NOW
I SAID DO ME A FAVOR
WE THEN CREATE THIS SPIRITUAL PERSONA THAT HAS TO BE BETTER THAN THE CORE IDENTITY
AND THEN THERE'S WHAT THE UNIVERSE WANTS YOU TO BE
AND SO FOR ME I REPRESENT THAT SHORTCUT FOR SO MANY PEOPLE IN THEIR LIVES BECAUSE I'VE GONE THROUGH IT
YES I SAID IN LIGHTS OUT PLEASE WEAR PINK OR RED SUNGLASSES BECAUSE SPECTRUM CHANGES THERE IS A FAMOUS MAN NAMED OTT O T T
WITH A REBREATHER IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME GEAR THAT YOU WOULD USE TO MAKE A SPACE WALK FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION
PLUS VEGETABLES AND ALL THAT STUFF SO I'M PROBABLY GETTING A HUNDRED
THAT CONFER A HEALTH AND LIFESPAN BENEFIT AND SO THE PURPOSE OF THE BOOK IS REALLY TO GO INTO THIS MOLECULAR BIOLOGY MECHANISM INSIDE THE CELL
SHOE GUY
AND I THINK AS MORE AND MORE OF THESE THINGS COME OUT THAT HELP PEOPLE ACTUALLY RECOVER
YOUR BODY SAYS BACTERIA
I HEARD A GREAT QUOTE BY JOHN WOODEN
I'M A BIG BELIEVER OF LEAVING IT ALL ON THE FIELD
AND THEY CAME IN A BROWN UNMARKED BOX
AMONG OTHER THINGS
A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS AND THINGS LIKE LYME DISEASE MAKE LIPOPHORIC TOXINS THINGS LIKE TOXIC MOLD MAKE LIPOPHORIC TOXINS
THEY NEED TO GET GREAT AT BODY WEIGHT EXERCISES WE WANT TO SEE KIDS BEING ABLE TO DO TEN PULL UPS
YUCK I DO THINK WASHING HANDS IS IMPORTANT
LIKE THE OLD DAYS OF ATKINS
I ALWAYS TELL THEM TO LISTEN
TODAY'S GUESTS ARE AIDAN GOGGINS AND GLEN MATTEN
AND THEY HAVE
DO I GO AND TRY IOWASKA DO I GO AND YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT THAT'S GOING TO
BUT CLEARLY IT'S AN UNCOMFORTABLE PLACE AND I KNOW PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES AS WELL
THE LAST FEW DAYS ABOUT HOW YOU'D BIO HACK THESE GUYS AND I'M NOT SURE IT'S DOABLE
I THINK ALL OF US KNOW WHEN WE'RE OUT OF ALIGNMENT WITH OURSELVES
BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO FIX ALL REST WITH SLEEP
SO ONE TENTH OF A DEGREE COLDER AND IT WOULD BE FROZEN SOLID
AND THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE I LOVE CONVERSATIONS LIKE THIS BECAUSE YOU CAN LEARN A LOT THERE AND HE'S KIND OF A BIG DEAL THOUGH BECAUSE HE'S BEEN ON OPERA ON HER SUPERSOUL SUNDAY SHOW HE'S WORKED ALONGSIDE DEEPAK CHOPRA WHO WAS JUST ON THE SHOW
GEEZ IT HAS TO BE TEN PLUS YEARS AGO BACK WHEN I WAS STILL A TECH GUY
AND THE TRUTH IS WHAT DO WE ACTUALLY NEED
I DIDN'T GO FAR ENOUGH TO WHAT REALLY RUNS US
AND THEN DO THAT ONE MORE TIME IN THE EVENING
WELL
AND WHEN WE TOOK THEM TO OUR BUTCHER WHO IS A HUMANE BUTCHER WHO WE INTERVIEWED BEFORE WE DECIDED TO DO IT
IT SPINS A LOT NORMALLY BUT IF I'M LIKE LOCKED IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION IT SPINS LIKE THIRTY THOUSAND MILES AN HOUR
WITHOUT A RING
MINOXIDIL
IF WE'RE EATING FOR THE MOST PART
MANY PLANETS OUT THERE WITH WORLDS LIKE OURS THAT THEY MADE
SO FIRST OF ALL IT'S GET QUIET
AND I WAS INTRODUCED TO A MANAGER THERE NAMED KIRAN RAO
AND WHEN I HEAR SOMEONE WHO SAYS I JUST CAN'T GET BY WITHOUT NINE HOURS OF SLEEP
RIGHT
SO LIPOPROTEINS ARE THERE TO TRAFFIC CHOLESTEROL BUT THEY ALSO TRAFFIC TRIGLYCERIDES AND SO YOU WANT YOUR SERUM TRIGLYCERIDES AS LOW AS POSSIBLE
IN ANY ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE SO DAVE
SO
ARE REALLY IMPORTANT
YOU'LL LEARN HOW YOU MIGHT CONSIDER NOT USING A HALLUCINOGEN LIKE THAT AND REPLACING IT INSTEAD WITH SOME POWERFUL BREATHING EXERCISES THAT YOU USE IN A GROUP SETTING
TAKE SEVEN DAYS
I DID THE RESEARCH
IT GOES INTO THAT FEELING OF COMMUNITY
HAVE A GREAT DAY
IT WAS PRETTY HELLISH

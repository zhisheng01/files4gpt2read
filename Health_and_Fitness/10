FASTER
THE PROBLEM AND THIS COMES FROM THE INTERVIEW WITH B J FOGG I JUST DID WHO'S A STANFORD BEHAVIORALIST AUTHOR OF TINY HABITS
YOU WANT TO LIVE FOR A VERY LONG TIME LIKE JAMES AND I ARE WORKING ON
A PSYCHIATRIST IN SEATTLE CALLED MURRAY RASKIND
EVEN WITH ALL THE TRAINING THAT I WAS DOING FOLLOWING THE BODYBUILDING STUFF
HOW DID YOU GET TO BE WHERE YOU ARE WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THIS AND WHY THE HECK ARE YOU QUALIFIED TO HACK SOME IMMUNE SYSTEMS
HE WOULD CHANGE HIS PLAN HE WOULD GO IN ANOTHER DIRECTION TRYING TO AVOID TO STAY AWAY FROM THE RISK
THERE'S A CREATOR
WHEN WHAT REALLY MATTER ARE THE OUTPUTS I REMEMBER RIGHT AFTER I GRADUATED FROM BUSINESS SCHOOL
SO IF WE CAN FIRST STOP THAT AND GET AHOLD OF OURSELVES
AND WHAT I SAY IS REPETITION IS LIKE RESEARCH FOR THE BRAIN
AND THESE FEEDBACK IN A SELF-REGULATORY FORMAT NOW IF YOU SHOW UP IN BLOODS AND SHOW THAT YOU HAVE LOW LEVELS OF THESE
WHERE YOU CAN STRIP AWAY THE PAINFUL STINGING EDGES OF THOSE EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES
THOSE THINGS ARE HIGH IN THESE BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACIDS TO KEEP MTOR TURNED ON
MAYBE YOU WERE GETTING Y TWO K MONEY OUT OF AN A T M I WAS DRIVING A CAB IN L A AND IN THE BACKSEAT THAT NIGHT WERE THESE TWO GUYS WHO WERE M B A INTERNS AT GOLDMAN SACHS AND I WAS OVERHEARING THEIR CONVERSATION
AND I HAD A GROUP OF FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS THAT WERE
NOW
EACH WORKOUT WOULD BE THREE EXERCISES
I BLOCKED THE NOISE
WE CAN HANDLE THIS WE CAN DO A LOT OF WORK JUST BURNING FAT AND SO THE MUSCLES BECOME LESS RELIANT ON KETONES AND THEY LITERALLY START SAVING THE KETONES SPARING THE KETONES FOR THE BRAIN
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE MARRIAGES OR OTHER KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT WORK BEST ARE THE ONES THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY THE COMMUNITY THAT THE COUPLE IS IN
YEAH THERE'S NO SIDE EFFECTS TRANSDERMALLY WHAT YOU WANT IS A DEPOT
AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN TRAINED TO USE IT
STAR TREK AND APOLLO SHAPE MY LIFE
UBIQUITOUS ACCESS TO ALL THE KNOWLEDGE IN THE WORLD OH MY GOD RIGHT
LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT
WITH FASTING WHAT WE KNOW IS THERE'S A CAP ON THE BENEFITS
EVEN THOUGH IT'S MOST OF THE HUNDRED EVEN THOUGH I'VE ONLY ONLY NEGOTIATED AWAY A LITTLE PIECE OF IT
WHICH NORMALLY STAY MICROSCOPIC
WE HAD FIFTEEN COACHES TWO OF THEM WERE NAVY SEALS
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE BUT IN EVERY PERSON THAT WE'VE USED THIS PLATFORM IT'S BEEN UNBELIEVABLY SAFE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
WHICH ISN'T GETTING THE GLUCOSE
HOW THE IMMUNE SYSTEM'S FUNCTIONING HOW THE GUT'S FUNCTIONING
SO EVERY FALL THERE'S ACORNS FROM THE OAK TREES AND HICKORY NUTS FROM THE HICKORY TREES AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER THINGS LIKE BERRIES AND WHATEVER THROUGHOUT THE YEAR
ALL OF THE LAYERS OF FEAR ALL OF THE LAYERS OF SURVIVAL
EVERYTHING ELSE IS JUST WINDOW DRESSING ON TOP OF A CORE THAT'S RESILIENT AND CAN TAKE WHAT THE WORLD BRINGS IT AND THEN BOUNCE BACK
ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE MOST ABOUT MY WIFE IS THAT WHEN I DO STUFF FOR HER
YOU FALL ASLEEP ONLY WHEN THE STUFF THAT'S COMING UP IS IRRELEVANT
CAUSE THOSE ARE STATISTICALLY SPEAKING ALONG WITH ACCIDENTS AS YOU POINTED OUT
WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER
NO THEY DON'T
MAKE SURE YOUR VITAMIN D LEVELS ARE DECENT
THAT CONVENIENCE FACTOR IS TERRIBLY IMPORTANT
IT IS A CATAPULTING
REM SLEEP JUST BURSTS ONTO THE SCENE WHEN YOU'RE AWAKE BECAUSE THE BRAIN IS SAYING LOOK IF YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME THE CHANCE TO GET REM SLEEP
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE
NEUTRALIZE ATTACKS
IF THESE KINDS OF MAJOR INTERNATIONAL CELEBRITY PERFORMERS CAN FEEL NERVOUS ABOUT GETTING IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE AND DOING THEIR THING
AND IT'S ALMOST CATALYTIC TO BE IN THEIR PRESENCE BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE IN THEIR PRESENCE ALL OF THESE LIMITATIONS ALL OF THESE FALSE IDENTIFICATIONS BEGIN TO FALL AWAY
THE ODDS OF EVERYONE YOU KNOW INCLUDING YOUR PARENTS INCLUDING YOUR ELDERS INCLUDING PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHO MAY BE SICK OR HAVE WEAK IMMUNE SYSTEMS
EXPOSED
IN OTHER WORDS I'M NOT SAYING DON'T GO OUT AND EAT AS MUCH PLANT MATTER AS YOU WANT I THINK YOU CAN'T OVERDO IT JUST EATING
SO THERE'S THIS ILLUSION THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THESE MANY DIFFERENT FORMS
I MIGHT NOT BE HERE
WELL WHEN WE LOOK AT POPULATIONS THAT HAVE UNDERGONE CALORIE RESTRICTION WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE OF WAR OR LIFESTYLE LIKE THE OKINAWANS
DO THEY GET FATIGUED DURING THE WARM UP
IF YOU FIND THE ENTHUSIASTS THE SUPER FANS OF THAT PARTICULAR TECHNIQUE
AND YET THAT'S HOW WE LIVE OUR LIVES
OH THAT POOR MAN
THEY TRIP BALLS
OKAY WHY
FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS
IT'S LIKE LOOK
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION DO YOU THINK HAS THIS KIND OF PROGRAMMING GOING ON IN THE U S
WE HAD HIS SANDALS WE HAD HIS PICTURE ON THE WALL
AND SO OUR WAY OF THINKING AROUND BRAIN HEALTH IS IDENTIFYING YOUR RISKS ACCORDING TO THE FOUR METRICS
I'M NOT FOR OR AGAINST LIQUID DIETS I JUST LIKE TO KNOW WHAT LIQUID THE DIET'S MADE OUT OF BECAUSE THE GASOLINE DIET PROBABLY IS A BAD IDEA
AND THAT'S WHAT CREATIVE REST DOES IT ACTUALLY HELPS YOU TO BE ABLE TO BE INSPIRED TO BE MOTIVATED AGAIN
YES IT'S ACTUALLY ORIGINATED IN FRANCE SEE I LIVE IN CANADA AND I STILL CAN'T PRONOUNCE FRENCH WORDS
AND IT WAS THE ORIGINAL VALIUM
BUT WHEN YOU START DOING THAT YOU REALIZE YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MAKES ME TIRED I DON'T LIKE IT AND YOU SAY I'M JUST GOING TO KEEP DOING IT I HAVE TO DO IT
NOW HOW WILL IT BE POSSIBLE THAT BIRTH THAT COULD BE TWENTY THIRTY FORTY HOURS WHERE THIS IS A
DID YOU HEAR ABOUT MR CARRERA
GIVE ME YOUR STORY MAN
A LOT OF WOMEN ARE DEALING WITH THIS
ON THIS SILENT KILLER WHICH UNFORTUNATELY BY MOST PHYSICIANS IS JUST COMPLETELY UNACKNOWLEDGED
I ALWAYS WANTED TO PERFORM WELL I THINK IT'S CORE TO BEING A HUMAN THAT WE WANT TO DO THAT
IT'S SO COMMON FOR ORGANIZATIONS TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS AND SO
HE SAID THERE'S WAY BETTER THINGS TO NEGOTIATE FOR IN A DEAL THAN PRICE
THEY RECOMMENDED THAT SLEEPING PILLS MUST NO LONGER BE THE FIRST LINE RECOMMENDATION FOR INSOMNIA
BUT THAT'S RELATIVELY CRUDE COMPARED TO THE PRECISION WITH WHICH WE CAN LOOK AT THINGS LIKE LIPOPROTEINS
LIKE CHOLESTEROL IS JUST THE STEROL FROM AN ANIMAL
DELICIOUS WHAT DID YOU NOTICE ABOUT IT
WHY IS IT THAT WE SEEM TO SYSTEMATICALLY WORK TO BREAK THAT SYSTEM
WHEN YOU'RE SITTING THERE ONSTAGE AND YOU LOOK AT A DOZEN IDEAS ALL OF WHICH HAVE INCREDIBLE WORLD CHANGER THINGS
SO I'VE DONE IT ALL I'VE DONE HYPNOTHERAPY I'VE DONE AND I TELL PEOPLE DO EVERYTHING DO ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING YOU CAN BECAUSE YOUR PROGRAMS ARE DEEP AND THEY'RE OLD
AND THAT HELPS WITH THAT INSPIRATION WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THE OTHER INNOVATIVE THINGS IN OUR LIFE
AT LEAST IN THE WEST
IT'S USUALLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO DO IT THEY HAVE TO SHIFT IT'S THE THINGS THAT MELTS US DOWN THAT RECASTS YOUR LIFE IN A NEW WAY THAT ACTUALLY LEADS US TO NEW OPPORTUNITIES AND NEW GATEWAYS OF THINKING AND BEING RIGHT
WHILE I WAS TRUCKLING WITH THIS CHALLENGE
YOU WAKE UP YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
FOOTBALL PLAYERS HAD A TOUGH GAME ON SUNDAY
EAT UP THIS THING THAT WILL KILL YOU'
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD SPIRITUAL VOCABULARY
LIKE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU HAVE IN THE BANK
AND MELATONIN ONLY HAPPENS IN STONE FRUITS IN JULY
AND MAYBE HE'D BE INTERESTED IN IT
NOW
HOW CAN I TURN THIS JOB INTO MY PASSION
SOME DAYS I'M FIFTY GRAMS BELOW THAT

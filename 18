1813.ELIJAH STARTED TO IDENTIFY AS GAY

1815.SO THEY LET ME WEAR IT
1816.STORED IT NEVER CHARGED US A PENNY AND MY BROTHER PAID WHAT HE PAID US
1817.EVERY SO OFTEN THE SKY LIT UP WITH LIGHTNING
1818.EVERY NIGHT HE DROVE BACK TO HIS PARENTS' HOUSE

1820.THEN I GOT A TEXT THAT WE HAD TO PICK UP MY DAUGHTER AT THE END OF THE PARADE ROUTE WHICH WAS TWO MILES FROM OUR CHAIRS
1821.IT MADE ME WANT TO BE VEGAN
1822.AND SHE WRITES I RECENTLY LEFT AN EMOTIONALLY ABUSIVE HOME FOR COLLEGE LAST NIGHT I WALKED OUT OF THE THEATRE AFTER A SPOKEN WORD POETRY PERFORMANCE BY ONE OF MY FAVORITE POETS
1823.THAT IS THE SPACE WHERE I WOULD HAVE INCLUDED AN INAPPROPRIATE JOKE BUT I JUST WANTED THERE TO BE SILENCE
1824.MY HUSBAND AND I WENT TO COLLEGE WITH HIM AND HIS WIFE
1825.THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
1826.SELF-SABOTAGE AND MANY MORE
1827.OTHER TIMES AFTER AN ARGUMENT SHE WOULD COME TO MY ROOM WHILE I WAS ASLEEP AND SIT ON THE EDGE OF MY BED NEVER SPEAKING
1828.IS THIS ISN'T ABOUT BLAME THIS IS ABOUT YOU NO LONGER MINIMIZING HOW MUCH IT HURT YOU
1829.MEANS TAKING RISKS AND BEING VULNERABLE AND WORKING THROUGH THE PAIN THAT WE'VE BURIED
1830.SEEING IT AND FEELING GUILTY AND ANXIOUS FOR WASTING IT
1831.CRAFTY WRITES ABOUT HER DEPRESSION
1832.AND RETA THINKS ON IT FOR A MOMENT AND THEN TELLS ME
1833.AND ABOUT HOW MUCH FUN SHE HAD

1841.EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS MY HEADSHOT UP IN HER OFFICE AND BRAGS TO HER COWORKERS ABOUT ME WHENEVER I'M ON TV
1842.AFTER THAT HAPPENED TO YOU DID YOU NOTICE A CHANGE IN YOUR OWN BEHAVIOR
1843.I FELT SO GOD DAMNED ALIVE
1844.ON AND ON THE ACCUSATIONS FLY
1845.REAL FRIENDS THAT JUST GIVE A SHIT I WISH FOR A BETTER FAMILY RELATIONSHIP
1846.GETTING IN MY BODY GETTING QUIET YOU KNOW MEDITATION ALL OF THAT
1847.GETTING A COMPASS AND
1848.NOW I FIND MYSELF HAVING A HARD TIME HAVING A DECENT RELATIONSHIP WITH PARTNERS OR FRIENDS
1849.IT WAS AT HOME THOUGH
1850.WHILST I WAS WAITING FOR HIM TO COLLECT ME FROM THE SHOPPING CENTER I NOTICED A POSTER ADVERTISING THAT YOU COULD WIN A SHOP SPACE WITH FREE RENT FOR A MONTH
1851.THAT WAS THE MOST HELPFUL IN COPING WITH LIFE THE WAY MY BRAIN ADDRESSES LIFE ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS
1852.SO I'VE KIND OF APPROACHED THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GET PARALYZED BY TOO MUCH
1853.DEALS WITH DEPRESSION ANXIETY BULIMIA
1854.YOU KNOW I HAD NOBODY SO I THOUGHT OK GREAT

1883.SO HE HAS MORE THAN ONE PENIS
1884.I JUST CAN'T MAKE MYSELF LET GO OF THE THINGS THEY'VE SAID DONE AND HELPED TO INTERNALIZE WITHIN ME THAT I'M NOW HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME UNLEARNING
1885.AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK THINGS CAN AND SHOULD CHANGE AND SO WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM
1886.LIKE WITH OTHERS TOM SAYS THE TOWN CLERK FAYE DID CALL HIM ABOUT JOHN SUICIDE

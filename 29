MRS BLACK
AS MUCH AS TWENTY FIVE INCHES OF RAIN FELL ON COASTAL AREAS
OKAY I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE
A STUDY SUGGESTS THAT DONOR STEM CELLS MAY PREVENT ORGAN REJECTION IN IMPERFECTLY MATCHED TRANSPLANT CASES
ALL COMMENTS ARE RECORDED IN FULL ON THE MEETING VIDEO RECORD
FOR WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE
SO FOR THE PART OF THE GENOME ABOUT TWO THREE OF THE GENOME TO WHICH YOU CAN MAP THESE SHORT FRAGMENTS WE'VE SEQUENCED IT MANY MANY TIMES OVER
HUMAN RESOURCES STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES
A TEAM OF NEW ZEALAND SCIENTISTS REPORT THAT MEASURING THE RATIO OF HYDROGEN AND METHANE LEVELS ON THE PLANET MARS MAY HELP DETERMINE THE LIKELIHOOD OF LIFE ON MARS
WELL
THANK YOU
THEN I'LL PICK DIABLO VALLEY COLLEGE
I'M JUST HONORED FRED TO HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH YOU TOWARD THAT END OVER THESE YEARS THANK YOU
I HAVEN'T HAD A SUMMER OFF IN FORTY YEARS SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS ONE
I THINK
AND NOT ONLY THAT
THIS IS GOING TO BE EQUAL TO THE MEAN THE MEAN HERE IS FOUR
WE THEN DIVIDE THAT BY THE NUMBER OF AGES THAT WE HAD
THE BOARD APPROVED A PARENT CHOICE VIRTUAL LEARNING OPTION FOR PARENTS AND SINCE THAT DECISION
RESEARCHERS DEVELOP A CRYSTALLINE QUANTUM COMPUTER COMPOSED OF JUST THREE HUNDRED ATOMS THAT THEORETICALLY IS SO POWERFUL THAT IT WOULD TAKE A CONVENTIONAL COMPUTER THE SIZE OF THE KNOWN UNIVERSE TO MATCH IT
BUT IN THE BIG SCHEME OF THINGS
HOWEVER BOTH WERE DELETED SHORTLY AFTER
OKAY
I WOULD LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN TO RETURN TO MY CAMPUS AND MEET MY NEW STUDENTS COLLABORATE WITH MY TALENTED COWORKERS AND PRINCIPAL AND SEE MY SUPPORTIVE PARENT COMMUNITY
IF ONLINE LEARNING CAN BE STREAMED OUT OF EACH CLASSROOM OR AT LEAST ONE CLASSROOM TEACHER PER GRADE
HE
EACH OTHER
I WAS
AND SO WHAT'S THE QUESTION MARK TWENTY ONE PLUS WHAT IS EQUAL TO TWENTY FOUR AND WE COULD OF COURSE
ALL THE WAY TO
SCIENTISTS DEMONSTRATE A TERAHERTZ ANTENNA ONE HUNDRED NANOMETERS ACROSS THIRTY THOUSAND TIMES SMALLER THAN THE PREVIOUS SMALLEST ANTENNA
HE WAS A SENIOR AT COSTA MESA HIGH SCHOOL AND PUTS A SUSPENSION NOTICE ON THE COUNTER
SO
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AT LEAST AT CDM HIGH SCHOOL
AT THE TIME QUITE A BIG SAMPLE NOT THIS BIG THIS WAS BOTH FOR CARBON DATING AND FOR THE DNA NOWADAYS WE TAKE MUCH SMALLER SAMPLES THAN THIS
BY PARENTS
SO IT'S THEIR CURRENT SCHOOL SAY IT BE DAVIS
NEAR THE END OF THE CODE BOOK
BEYOND WHAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN SOME EARLY INFORMATION ON ADULTS AT SCHOOL IS ENCOURAGING
AND SO THEY AREN'T IN THEIR QUOTE UNQUOTE HOME SCHOOL BUT THEY'RE IN A DIFFERENT SCHOOL THROUGH THE PROCESS
SO IF WE STICK A CD BYTE AT THE END OF THAT AND
WILL BE READ COMMENCING AT THREE O'CLOCK
SO WE ENCOURAGED AND NURTURED THESE ONLINE FORUMS
WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THAT TONIGHT'S AGENDA ITEM IS FOCUSED ON A MODEL FOR REOPENING
SO I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
SO THE OVERHEAD IS LIKE THREE MORE BYTES
HE AND DR
YOU REMEMBER THAT FRED WALKING IN AND OUT OF GUITAR SHOPS TO FIND THE RIGHT GUITAR FOR HIS SON
PLEASE OPEN SCHOOLS BACK UP
YOU RECALCULATED THE MEAN
WE'RE GONNA DIVIDE BY THE NUMBER OF AGES
AN ENCODER IS A COMPUTERIZED WAY OF LOOKING UP A CODE AND IT CAN LEAD YOU DOWN THE WRONG PATH IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TERMS ARE USED IN THE CODE BOOK
AND
I'M JUST WONDERING DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF I KNOW THIS ALL DEPENDS ON HOW MANY STUDENTS SIGN UP
THEIR SONGS ARE POETRY-BASED AND WHEN HIS POETRY IS TOO LONG HE STATED THAT HE NEEDS TO START RAPPING TO FIT THE LYRICS IN
IN ADDITION
ON THE SAME NOTE
WILL VIRUS TESTING BE AVAILABLE FOR STUDENTS AND STAFF
THE HURRICANE WAS LESS SEVERE THAN INITIALLY PREDICTED THOUGH MITCH STILL CAUSED HEAVY RAINFALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY
THERE HAS TO BE SOME WAY THE TEACHER UNION CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO OFFER LEAVES TO THOSE THAT NEED IT AND ALLOW FOR TEACHERS THAT WANT TO GO AND TEACH TO DO SO
THIS METHOD OF BLIND QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY MAY PERMIT SENSITIVE DATA TO BE PROCESSED AND TRANSFERRED WITHOUT ANY DANGER OF INTERCEPTION OR DECRYPTION LEADING TO ULTRA-SECURE CLOUD COMPUTING
THE COHORTS IN
ALEX MOULTON ENGLISH MECHANICAL ENGINEER AND INVENTOR B
THOUGH I'M SUPPOSING THESE THINGS ARE WELL UNDERWAY
CONTINUE TO SPREAD OUT AND MIX AGAIN AT LEAST ONCE IT SEEMS PERHAPS SOMEWHERE IN CENTRAL ASIA SO WITH THE ANCESTORS OF PRESENT DAY ASIANS
HOW ARE THE PARENTS BEING NOTIFIED DOES EVERYONE IN EACH OF THOSE KIDS' FAMILIES NEED TO BE TESTED
BUT
UNFORTUNATELY
SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT GETTING A NEW BASEBALL COACH
AND I FOUND THE CODE
WHICH LEADS TO MY NEXT POINT
WAS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH
SO
WHAT IF SOMEONE LIVES IN THE SAME HOUSE AS A TEACHER THAT TESTS POSITIVE
SO I REALLY WANNA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY
WHAT PROTECTION IS THE DISTRICT PUTTING IN PLACE FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS
MOST OF ALL THEY NEED A LEADER IN THE SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE WHO CAN REGAIN THE TRUST OF THE PUBLIC
ROOM FOR EXPLORATION HERE
THE ONE COHORT
AND AGAIN THERE'S SO MANY TIMES WE WERE FORTUNATE TO BE IN THIS DISTRICT AND IN THIS COMMUNITY WHERE WE DO HAVE RESOURCES EVEN IN A BUDGET CRISIS YEAR
MY COMMENT IS REGARDING THE HYBRID MODEL
MAKES SENSE
JOHANSON AND HIS TEAM AS WE ALL KNOW WERE IN ETHIOPIA IN A PLACE CALLED HADAR
YOU KNOW AND I'M FROM CENTRAL
THREATENING THE YUCATAN PENINSULA
THE MODEL ASSUMES THAT SUBSURFACE LIQUID WATER COULD HOST ALIEN LIFE IN ADDITION TO THE SURFACE WATER THAT SCIENTISTS ARE SEARCHING FOR ON NEARBY EXOPLANETS
IF WE PLAN WELL
USING COMPLEX ALGORITHMS RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT POP SONGS OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY LOUDER AND MORE BLAND IN TERMS OF THE CHORDS MELODIES AND TYPES OF SOUND USED
IT WAS STILL A LOST THREE MONTHS FOR OUR CHILDREN ACADEMICALLY AND SOCIALLY
HOW IS IT OKAY TO PUT KIDDOS TEACHERS STAFF PARENTS AND FAMILIES
SO THIS REQUIREMENT I THINK DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO WITH SECURITY SO MUCH I THINK IT'S JUST FOR CONVENIENCE BECAUSE THEY JUST WANT TO HAVE A STANDARD LAYOUT FOR THE PROGRAM
WHO COULD HAVE IMAGINED THE GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PAINFUL CHALLENGES THAT OUR HIGH SCHOOL WAS TO EXPERIENCE
I THINK THERE'S SOME PARENTS THAT DEFINITELY NEED AND PREFER TO HAVE THEIR KIDS IN SCHOOL EVERY SINGLE MORNING
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION AND THEIR NO MASK STANCE
WE CAN LOOK AT THE JAVASCRIPT CONSOLE HERE
WE HAVE A LOT OF COMMENTS WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS
IF SCHOOL IS TO REOPEN IT MUST HAVE A MITIGATION PLAN IN PLACE FOR SECONDARY STUDENTS
I WAS JUST KIND OF REMINDED THIS DOCUMENTARY THAT I WATCHED ABOUT THE DOMESTICATION OF DOGS AND THEY WERE
IN FACT
PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE AT RISK

606.AH CLASS FROM ONE OF THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS
607.AND I WOULD SOMETIMES PUT GEL IN MY HAIR WHICH
608.BUT I WANTED TO READ THAT BECAUSE
609.THERE WASN'T TIME TO GO RECORD TOMORROW
610.BECAUSE I WAS FILLED WITH SO MUCH PANIC AND GUILT THAT I WAS ABOUT TO BURST INTO TEARS
611.SO YOU KNOW BUT THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO YOU KNOW WORK ON
612.BUT HE SAID THAT THE CRIME THAT SENT HIM TO PRISON THE FIRST TIME
613.MONTHS
614.IT WOULD BE I HATE YOU I HATE THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO LOVE YOU ONLY BECAUSE WE SHARE SOME DNA I HATE HOW YOU TREATED ME
615.TRIP
616.I SAW THAT IN HIM AND THAT'S PART OF WHY I REACHED OUT TO HIM JOHN B MCLEMORE'S EDUCATION IS THE SOURCE OF SOME GOSSIP IN WOODSTOCK
617.SADLY JUST NOT IN YOUR HOME AND
618.IT'S ALSO ABOUT MUSIC AS THERAPY AND EAR HUSTLERS MIGHT RECOGNIZE THE GUY TALKING
619.AND EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T SURE OF THE RIGHT THING TO DO
620.AND THEN YOU SEE YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT RUN OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE PROBABLY MORE SICK THAN US AS VICTIMS ARE
621.THIS STORY PICKS UP WITH HIM TALKING ABOUT HIS SISTER COMING TO VISIT HIM IN PRISON
622.AND DIDN'T REPORT THE OTHER
623.WHY
624.CATHARTIC
625.THAT SINCE HE PROPOSED
626.ABOUT LIVING WITH AN ABUSER
627.THAT'S KIND OF THOSE TWO I JUST
628.ALMOST DRAGGED HIM INTO A BATHROOM AFTER A FUNERAL TWO YEARS AGO IT'S DISGUSTING
629.SHE'S GROWN UP NOW AND BETTER BUT I STRUGGLE TRYING TO FORGIVE HER AND MY DAD I LOVE THEM SO MUCH

635.THIS IS AN AWFULSOME MOMENT FILLED OUT BY I'M DEPRESSED HI DEPRESSED I'M DAD
636.HE ON HIS WAY BACK TO THE PLACE HE WAS STAYING
637.IT'S KIND OF NICE
638.I REMEMBER DISTINCTLY ONE REALLY FUCKED-UP COPING MECHANISM I HAD WAS TO SIT ON THE FLOOR ON MY KNEES AND JUST LIKE BASH MY FOREHEAD INTO THE GROUND UNTIL LIKE MY HEAD WAS NUMB
639.AND I TOLD HER TO FUCK OFF AND LEFT HER HOUSE FOR THE LAST TIME
640.THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOME GOOD SOLID ADVICE TO ME
641.IT'S ALL ABOUT TOOLS MAN
642.IT DOES TAKE WORK
643.CONFLICT AVOIDANCE AND PASSIVE AGGRESSION
644.SORT OF
645.FILLED OUT BY A WOMAN WHO CALLS HERSELF RIGORI GASPUTIN
646.I'VE SAID IT BEFORE I'LL SAY IT AGAIN NOBODY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM WHEN THEY ARE DRUNK OR PASSED OUT
647.BUT I WONDER

657.WERE THERE ANY OTHER SPOTS LIKE OUTSIDE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
658.I LEARNED THAT NONE OF THEM WERE AT JOHN'S FUNERAL BECAUSE NONE OF THEM WERE CONTACTED IN TIME
659.ONE WHO'S THROUGH IT
660.WAS THAT WORTH IT
661.BECAUSE YOU ARE A FUCKING AWESOME MOM
662.I WOULD WANT HIM TO GET A DICTIONARY AND LOOK UP THE WORDS BITTER ENTITLED AND RESENTFUL AND TELL HIM THAT IF HE CAN LET GO IT'S POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO BE HAPPY
663.OH
664.I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO
665.NOBODY WANT TO CELL WITH THEM
666.THEY HAVE HOPE
667.AND I GUESS I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH JUST EPISODES NUMBER THREE WITH THIS EAR HUSTLE BECAUSE LOOKING OUT WHICH WAS PETS IN PRISON WASN'T MY FAVORITE
668.UM AND
669.HE'S READING SOMETHING HE WROTE ABOUT THE INSANITY OF GETTING PROCESSED INTO PRISON
670.WELL THERE'S A LOT OF GUYS IN HERE WHO CUT HAIR BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO LOOK SHARP
671.NEURO-FUNCTION IS THAT A WORD NEURO-FUNCTION
672.BUT IN OFTEN WITHIN EARSHOT OF THE GUARDS AND PRISONERS
673.AND SHE USED TO
674.SHE JUST
675.MAYBE I HAVEN'T BUT
676.AND THAT SOMETHING THAT
677.I'M NOT KIDDING
678.A GIANT CYCLOPS COMES WALKING UP
679.I COULD BARELY THINK
680.IS THAT TRAUMA SHAPES US ALL IN OUR LIVES ESPECIALLY CHILDHOOD TRAUMA

687.LOVE LOVE HEARING THAT
688.BY THE WAY THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO'VE GONE THROUGH FAR MORE THAN I HAVE AND ARE YOU KNOW JUST AS ADJUSTED AND EVERYTHING SO
689.AND THEN I DIDN'T GO TO THERAPY FOR YEARS AND I WAS SEEING SOMEONE AND WE SPLIT
690.I WORRY WHEN I'M FEELING REALLY SENTIMENTAL THAT I'M GOING TOWARDS HYPOMANIA IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH SOMEONE WHO SHARES YOUR THOUGHTS OR EXPERIENCES
691.FUCKED YOU UP TODAY
692.HOW HARD YOU'RE BEING ON YOURSELF
693.YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S IMMUNE TO TRAUMA YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'VE DISCOVERED IS THAT
694.BLOOD PRESSURE WAS TAKEN SEVERAL TIMES A DAY I MET WITH THE SHRINK AND DID NOT LIKE HIM
695.IT STARTS IN MY THROAT AND MOVES DOWNWARD THROUGH MY CHEST EXPANDING AS IT SPREADS OUTWARD IN A SENSATION SIMILAR TO THAT OF DRINKING ICE COLD WATER FIRST THING IN THE MORNING
696.YOU KNOW
697.I USUALLY JUST GO FOR IT AND THEN I'D SAY FIFTY PERCENT OF THE TIME I SURPRISE MYSELF AND EVEN THOUGH I WAS COMPLETELY TAXED
698.AH
699.IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT RESONATES WITH WHO I AM I'M A WOMAN
700.THAT WAS ANOTHER BYPRODUCT OF THE CHEAP OIL ECONOMY

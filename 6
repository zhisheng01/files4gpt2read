MISS METOYER
SWEDISH SURGEONS REPORT HAVING IMPLANTED A PATIENT WITH A WORKING LAB-GROWN VEIN CREATED WITH THE PATIENT'S OWN STEM CELLS
SCIENTISTS HAVE ACHIEVED A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN DECIPHERING BREAD WHEAT'S GENETIC CODE
OKAY AND HERE'S WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE
SMALL KIDS SHOULD PLAY WITH KIDS
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO ADDRESS THE BOARD REGARDING ITEMS ON THE REGULAR MEETING AGENDA
IT WERE
PLEASE THANK YOUR STAFF THANK THE PRINCIPALS
WE ARE
HOWEVER THE STUDY IGNORES FACTORS SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE AND GEOPOLITICS
THESE GUIDELINES ARE NOT LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR EVEN RULES
AS ALWAYS GOOD HYGIENE WITH FREQUENT HAND WASHING AND THE USE OF HAND SANITIZER SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED
A PLEA ONLY BECAUSE GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES CURRENTLY
AND I'D BE SITTING THERE GOING HOW DID YOU SEE ALL THAT IN FIVE MINUTES
WHO WILL PAY FOR THAT STUDENT'S FAMILY'S COVID NINETEEN TEST
BUT THEY'RE DOING STUFF ON THE COMPUTER
SCHOOL MUST REOPEN WITH THE KIDS BACK IN SCHOOL FULL TIME VIRTUAL LEARNING WAS A COMPLETE DISASTER I AM NOT WORRIED ABOUT MY CHILDREN CONTRACTING CORONAVIRUS AT SCHOOL
REGARDING THE TELACU
DO YOU HAVE ADEQUATE SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS FOR THESE TWO WEEK PERIODS
THANK YOU
INVEST IN THEIR STUDENTS AND AT THE SAME TIME BE WITH THEIR FAMILIES WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING QUARANTINED
CLARIFICATION FOR EVERYBODY WATCHING
HOWEVER UNTIL ORANGE COUNTY CAN SLOW AND REDUCE THE RATE OF INFECTION
OVER THESE YEARS OF GETTING TO KNOW YOU I'VE OBSERVED A LEADER WHO DOES NOT SEEK THE SPOTLIGHT
HOW MANY YARDS WERE IMPORTED TO FILL THE HOLE YOU DUG
BUT ESPECIALLY FOR CLASSES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED
IT'S A DIRECTION I THINK I SEE OUR COLLEGE GOING IN
AND TO KEEP OUR STUDENTS ON CAMPUS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
CARIBBEAN SEA MITCH WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOSS OF THE FANTOME WINDJAMMER SAILING SHIP OWNED BY WINDJAMMER BAREFOOT CRUISES ALL THIRTY ONE OF THE CREW PERISHED
YES
WE NEED TO CONSIDER THIS NOT AS A ONE YEAR SCHOOL
ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE
OKAY
THE INTERACTION WAS A LITTLE
NOT ALLOWED TO BE ON CAMPUS
GEOSCI
THE HURRICANE CAUSED STRONG WAVES GUSTY WINDS
THAT'S REAL DIVERSITY
THE OTHER PART ON THE BOTTOM
LAND INTERACTION IMPARTED WEAKENING
I GUESS IT'S NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO
BUT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT CANNOT SOLVE THE NATIONAL POLICY VACUUM
CAN YOU PLEASE PROVIDE ASSURANCES THAT IF THEY CHOOSE THE VIRTUAL OPTION THIS YEAR
YOU KNOW
ARE SUSPENDED AND THE TEAM HAS ONE OTHER PITCHER WHO HAS PITCHED ONLY ONE INNING THIS SEASON
IT IS ESPECIALLY CRUCIAL FOR POOR NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE MORE DEPENDENT ON SCHOOLS FOR DAILY MEALS
COMMENT FROM KELLY FOLEY
THANK YOU
NOW I'M SEEING BAYES NETWORKS AND EXAMPLES OF GAME THEORY EVERYWHERE I LOOK
WHAT'S GOING ON
YES
THIS OPERATION THE FIRST OF ITS KIND COULD HERALD A NEW ERA OF ACCURATE PATIENT-TAILORED ARTIFICIAL TRANSPLANTS
HIS ATTENTION AND FOCUS ON ADVOCATING FOR KIDS
GOOD JOB DR NAVARRO
ARCHAEOLOGISTS FIND A NOVEL TULIP-SHAPED FOSSIL FORMALLY NAMED SIPHUSAUCTUM GREGARIUM IN THE MIDDLE CAMBRIAN BURGESS SHALE IN THE CANADIAN ROCKIES
SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING HERE IS THAT HOMESCHOOL TRANSPORTATION WILL BE LIMITED AND AVAILABLE SPACE HAS TO PRIORITIZE OUR SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS
AREA MODEL DIVISION
AT THIS POINT
THIS IS A NEANDERTHAL SKELETON ON THE LEFT COMPARED TO A MODERN HUMAN SKELETON
OR LEI GONG TENG THAT HAS LONG BEEN USED IN TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE WIPES OUT PANCREATIC TUMORS IN MICE AND MAY SOON BE TESTED IN HUMANS
OKAY THAT'S HOW I'M UNDERSTANDING IT YEAH ALL KIDS SHOW UP
AND THOSE COMMENTS WE WILL READ NOW AND THEY HAVE THREE MINUTES
THIS IS ME BEING INSPIRED BY MY FIRST TUTOR MY MOM
ONLINE LEARNING AFTER TAKING THREE WEEKS TO EVEN BE ORGANIZED WAS A COMPLETE JOKE
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACTUALLY PUBLICLY SAY
YOU KNOW ANY DESIGN THAT WE COME UP WITH IS NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT
BUT I MUST SAY ALSO THAT I'M A LITTLE BIT INTIMIDATED BY THE SUBJECT MATTER WHEN I GOT THIS LETTER
I DID A BUNCH OF THEM
IT IS THE MOST POTENT GENETIC RISK FACTOR FOR ALZHEIMER'S IDENTIFIED IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS
AUSTRALIAN RESEARCHERS PUBLISH A NEW STUDY REVEALING HOW THE ZEBRAFISH HEALS ITS SPINAL CORD AFTER INJURY
PLEASE SUPPORT SUPPORT EFFORTS TO PROVIDE DISTANCE LEARNING OPTIONS FOR PARENTS WHO DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE SENDING THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL THIS COMING SCHOOL YEAR
THE DEATH OF LONESOME GEORGE PROBABLY AGED OVER ONE HUNDRED RENDERS THE PINTA ISLAND TORTOISE PROBABLY EXTINCT
I KNOW THAT IN SPEAKING TO SHOSHANA SHE'S HAPPY TO BE BACK
BUT THE SURPRISE WAS THAT THE MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME ACTUALLY GOES BACK TO COMMON ANCESTOR WITH THE DENISOVAN MITOCHONDRIAL DNA BUT FAR BACK
PROVIDE A LOT MORE DETAIL
YOU'RE ON MUTE
ALONG WITH HURRICANE GEORGES MITCH WAS THE MOST NOTABLE HURRICANE IN THE SEASON
GOING BACK TO THE ASSIST REPORT
AND THAT'S WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT IN OUR PROFESSION AND DR NAVARRO IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT
SO WITH THAT
IN REGARDS TO THEIR LOGO TYLER JOSEPH STATED IN AN INTERVIEW THAT ACCORDING TO THE BAND THEIR PURPOSE FOR MAKING MUSIC IS TO MAKE PEOPLE THINK
RUSSELL ABOUT
OKAY SO WE'LL CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION
ACCORDING TO A NEW SCIENTIFIC MODEL
AND WOULD THEY GET NOW ONE OF THE COMPLAINTS WAS THAT SOME TEACHERS DIDN'T SPEND MORE THAN FIVE OR TEN MINUTES WITH THEIR STUDENTS WOULD THEY GET THE FULL YOU KNOW
BECOMING EXTREMELY NUMEROUS SPREADING ACROSS WATER OVER LONG DISTANCES COUNTLESS MODERN HUMANS AND SO ON
THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS
AND THAT IS THE LAST ONE
SO WHAT WE THEN HAVE ARE THESE GOOD GENOMES FROM SIBERIA
I MEAN THIS IS WHERE WE'RE GETTING IN THE WEEDS I'M JUST AM PROPOSING A HYBRID OF OUR OPTION
WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AT THIS POINT IN TIME
CUBA ALSO VOLUNTEERED SENDING A CONTINGENT OF PHYSICIANS TO THE COUNTRY
IF PARENTS DON'T WANT TO SEND THEIR KIDS BACK FINE
THAT I MAY INSTEAD END UP ON A VENTILATOR
SO DOES THAT MAKE SENSE THIS IS THEIR SORT OF BIG IDEA FOR RUNNING THIS ENFORCING SAFETY WITHOUT SUPPORT FROM THAT OPERATING SYSTEM AT SOME LEVEL
AND THERE ARE SOME HINTS BEGINNING TO BE SOME HINTS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT THAT MAY BE THE CASE
WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE WAYS WE CAN INCREASE INSTRUCTION TIME FOR THESE STUDENTS
AND THE KISTLER PRIZE IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE
WHO WILL BE TEACHING VIRTUAL CLASSES HOW LARGE WILL THE CLASSES BE
AND THE FOLLOWING FOR LEVEL TWO WITH THE WEDNESDAY HALF MORNING FOR ALL STUDENTS

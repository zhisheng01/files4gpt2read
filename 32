A TABLE MAINTAINED BY THE HARDWARE
WHEN A HUGE METEOR COLLIDED WITH EARTH ABOUT TWO POINT FIVE MILLION YEARS AGO AND FELL INTO THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC OCEAN IT NOT ONLY COULD HAVE GENERATED A MASSIVE TSUNAMI BUT MAY ALSO HAVE PLUNGED THE WORLD INTO THE ICE AGES A NEW STUDY SUGGESTS
YES
I THINK ARE ALLEVIATED THAT I HAVE SIMILAR FEELINGS ABOUT
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE WEIGHT OF THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU MUST BE FEELING THESE DAYS
IT'S BEEN ENJOYABLE AND TRULY INSPIRING TO WORK WITH YOU ON VARIOUS PROJECTS AND TO SEE HOW YOU CARE FOR THE STUDENTS IN THE DISTRICT
SEGMENTATION
I AM AN AIRLINE PILOT AND OUR UNION GOT OUR AIRLINE TO OFFER LEAVES TO THOSE THAT NEEDED TO TAKE IT
SO I CAN PLAY THAT OR WE CAN MOVE ON
WHAT OBJECTIVE HEALTH DATA WAS USED TO MAKE THE DECISION TO REOPEN SCHOOLS
SO ALL OF THESE
SO WHAT THEY DO IS THEY ACTUALLY PUT A HALT INSTRUCTION AS THE FIRST BYTE OF THIS THIRTY TWO BYTE MULTIPLE SEQUENCE
THE FINDINGS COULD LEAD TO MORE EFFECTIVE ANTIDEPRESSANT THERAPIES
THERE IS ONLY A LITTLE OVER A MONTH TILL CLASSES ARE TO BEGIN
FULL DAYS AND PROVIDE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS
FURTHER STUDY MAY REVEAL THE GENETIC MECHANISM BEHIND THIS RESISTANCE ALLOWING NEW CANCER TREATMENTS TO BE DEVELOPED
WHY ARE WE SAYING IT IS FOR TARGETED STUDENT ENRICHMENT AND TEACHER DEVELOPMENT
SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS
FOR SOME OF KIND OF OUR SAFETY PROTOCOLS
I AM IN MY PRIME EXPERIENCED KNOWLEDGEABLE ADAPTABLE
THE LACK OF PROTOCOLS OF HOW STUDENTS
THESE CERTIFICATED STAFF MEMBERS NEED DIRECT AND MEANINGFUL RESPONSES THAT ONLY YOU CAN PROVIDE
THERE WAS MATT BURN PAUL REED WHO WAS PAID A HEFTY SALARY NOT TO REHIRE AND WHOSE WIFE
OKAY
MEXICO QUICKLY GAVE HELP SENDING SEVEN HUNDRED TONS OF FOOD ELEVEN TONS OF MEDICINE FOUR RESCUE PLANES
DO WE WANT TO HAVE ALL STUDENTS BUT WE ALSO IF WE OPT AND GIVE PARENTS A CHOICE MAYBE THEY WOULD CHOOSE TO DO SOMETHING ELSE WITH THEM THAT DAY MAYBE THEY WOULD CHOOSE TO DO ASYNCHRONOUS
MY REQUEST
THERE YOU GO SO
THE ADMINISTRATORS WHO RESPOND TO YOU EARN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE OR MORE
COMMENT ELIZABETH GOULD
THEY ARE NOT GETTING THE SOCIAL INTERACTION THEY NEED TO THRIVE AND DEVELOP AND THEY ARE NOT GETTING THE STRUCTURE SCHOOL HAS TO OFFER
SO THE QUESTION MARK IS EQUAL TO THREE
SINCE THOSE ARE RELATED TO THIS METASTATIC CANCER WE WANT TO CODE THOSE AS WELL
SO I'M ANTICIPATING ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO SCREEN SUBSTITUTES
YOU NEED TO ARRANGE FOR CHILDCARE FOR THE HALF DAY THAT YOUR CHILD IS NOT INSIDE THE CLASSROOM IN PERSON
SO TO UNDERSTAND THIS LET'S LOOK AT ONE OF THOSE CLASSES THE MACHINE LEARNING CLASS OFFERED BY MY
WELL AND I ALSO HOPE THAT WE CONSIDER DIFFERENT MODALITIES
SO THIS IS I THINK REASONABLY CLEAR THEN
LOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME IN AN EARLY MODERN HUMAN THAT LIVED AT THIS TIME AND SAY
DOES CDM MIDDLE SCHOOL AND CDM HIGH SCHOOL USE IT IT SOUNDS LIKE A WISE IDEA
JUST HAS THE RESOLUTION
AND NOT ALL REASONABLE CANDIDATES LIVE OR LOOK LIKE YOU
WE SUPPORT A ONE HUNDRED PERCENT APPROACH NOW FOR THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS
AND I STARTED PHRASING THIS AS TRADE OFFS
WHEN YOU VIEW AGREEMENT BY DEPARTMENT IT IS LITERALLY JUST TELLING YOU
GOOD AFTERNOON
INCLUDING RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC TAUNTS
SO SOME FUNCTION CALLS LIKE MALLOC OR PTHREAD CREATE
COMMENT BY CANDICE WHITELEY THERE ARE TOO MANY UNKNOWNS
WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO DO ANY ONE OF THOSE THREE LEVELS AT ANY POINT THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL YEAR
INVESTIG DERMATOL
TWO PLUS FOUR IS SIX PLUS EIGHT IS FOURTEEN
THERE WILL NEED TO BE CLOSE COMMUNICATION WITH PARENTS ESPECIALLY IN UPPER GRADES FOUR THROUGH SIX TO TRANSLATE THE CREDENTIALED TEACHING TO THE HOME
GREAT THANK YOU
OF WHEN I WAS PRESIDENT GOING INTO RUBY'S WE KNOW THEM ALL BY NAME AND ENJOYING IT AMAZINGLY
HOW ARE KIDS AND TEACHERS GOING TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE
WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO ON WEDNESDAYS
WITH THE NEWS OF OUR NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES
AND I THINK WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THERE'S DIFFERENT
WE NEED TO STOP ASKING WHAT IS BEST FOR US AND START ASKING WHAT IS BEST FOR THE STUDENTS
TRUSTEE YELSEY
I AGREE THAT IF PARENTS CHOOSE NOT TO SEND THEIR CHILD BACK TO SCHOOL THAT IT IS THEIR RIGHT
I ASK THAT YOU KEEP IN MIND THESE POTENTIAL STRAINS ON YOUR DISTRICT BOTH IN THE SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM THAT WILL OCCUR WITH LOOSER REOPENING PLANS AMID THE COUNTY WIDE AND STATE WIDE CONTINUED CLIMB IN COVID NINETEEN NUMBERS
DON'T THEY RANKLE YOU
THE NEXT DAY
DEFINITELY INTERESTED IN HOW EDUCATION INTERPLAYS WITH EDUCATION
WE HAD TO SWITCH TO LEVEL THREE
ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE BECAUSE OF DIRECT RESULT OF
AND SO THAT'S THE WORK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
IS THERE GOING TO BE TEACHING AND NOT JUST HOMEWORK CHECKING IN IS NOT CLASS TIME
SO ANYWAY THAT THEY'RE JUST KIND OF
ACCORDING TO THE BOARD OF THE OCTOBER SEVENTH
I KNOW THAT WHEN WE RETURN WE WILL GET USED TO WEARING MASKS AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO ADAPT OUR PRACTICES TO ACCOMMODATE SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS
THIS TIME WE ARE LOOKING AT THE METASTATIC CANCER TO THE BRAIN
ONE CAN OF COURSE DISCUSS IF THAT'S PART OF SOME RITUAL BURIAL OR SO
IF TEACHERS DON'T FEEL SAFE ALLOW THEM TO TAKE LEAVE OF ABSENCE OR PROVIDE A SAFE SEALED BUBBLES FOR THEM TO SIT AND TEACH FROM
AND ONCE YOU'VE CHECKED THE APPLICATION'S BINARY AND IT ALL PASSES
AS MUCH AS FORTY FOUR BILLION TONS OF NITROGEN AND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION TONS OF CARBON STORED IN ARCTIC PERMAFROST COULD BE RELEASED OVER THE NEXT CENTURY ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY LED BY THE U S GEOLOGICAL SURVEY
SO YES I THINK THERE WERE EATING GOING ON
COMMENT GRETCHEN KOPPE
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE REOPENING OF ORANGE COUNTY SCHOOLS
MOST ONLINE CLASSES THE VIDEOS ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE
PEOPLE ON THIS WEBINAR
YEAH I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY RECOMMEND THAT
PLEASE OPEN OUR SCHOOLS
WE HAD INTENDED TO DO BOTH ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY
WHICH GENERATED A LOT OF DISCUSSION IN TERMS OF IF WE HAD TO CHOOSE SOMETHING OTHER THAN NUMBER ONE
SORRY
ARE WE NIMBLE ENOUGH
TWO BESIDES MASKS FOR STUDENTS AND DESKS BEING A CERTAIN DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER
BUT WHAT DID CHANGE WAS THE LAYOUT OF THE FENCING AND THE LAYOUT OF WHERE BENCHES MIGHT BE BASED ON FEEDBACK FROM OUR SECURITY CONSULTANT TO PROVIDE FOR BETTER LOCATIONS FOR THE STAFF AND BETTER FLOW AT THE FRONT OF THE CAMPUS
THE MOST CONSISTENT OPTION WE HAVE IS DISTANCE LEARNING
AMPLIFYING SHORT PIECES
ALL OF THESE STUDENTS PERFORMED BEAUTIFULLY ON ZOOM
AND IF YOU NOW GO AND STUDY ON A WORLDWIDE SCALE HUMAN GENETIC VARIATION
SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A STRONG SELF SUFFICIENT STUDENT
SO WE ARE JUST DELIGHTED TO HAVE HER COME ON BOARD AND JOIN OUR TEAM
SHOULD WE REALLY BE REQUIRING THAT ALL OUR STAFF AND STUDENTS
RESEARCHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT MANY SPECIES OF FRUIT FLY WILL BE UNABLE TO SURVIVE EVEN A MODEST INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE

SO ALL WE'RE LEFT IS
LIKE TODAY
BUT I WILL ALSO SAY THE DISTANCE LEARNING WILL NEVER BE A REPLACEMENT A FULL REPLACEMENT OF IN-PERSON LEARNING LIKE WE WERE DESIGNED TO DO
COMMENT FROM CINDY BRAZDA
TRUSTEE ANDERSON
SO WE ARE NOT FULLY SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO OFFER THE EXTENDED LEARNING DAY
WHAT IS HAPPENING FOR ELEMENTARY STUDENTS WHEN THEY'RE ON CAMPUS BUT NOT IN THEIR CLASSROOM
AN INTERNATIONAL TEAM OF SCIENTISTS REPORTS THAT GRAPHENE ALREADY WIDELY KNOWN FOR ITS CONDUCTIVE PROPERTIES IS ALSO ABLE TO SELECTIVELY FILTER GASES AND LIQUIDS
LET'S TRY TO RUN IT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS
ALL RIGHT SO I GUESS THAT'S IT FOR NATIVE CLIENT
DOES IT ALSO HAVE DENISOVAN CONTRIBUTION
THANK YOU
AND I UNDERSTAND THE MEETING TODAY IS TO DECIDE ON A PLAN FOR THOSE THREE
THERE IS NO WAY TEACHERS CAN RETURN TO WORK AS SCHEDULED AND BE READY TO TEACH BY AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH THANK YOU
TRUSTEE BARTO
PLEASE ALSO CONSIDER STUDENTS WITH APPROVED INTERDISTRICT TRANSFERS WHO OFFER DISTANCE LEARNING AS WELL
GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME IT'S DELIGHTFUL TO SEE SUCH A GIGANTIC CROWD
THE GOVERNMENT OF BELIZE ISSUED A PURPLE ALERT AND ASKED FOR CITIZENS ON OFFSHORE ISLANDS TO LEAVE FOR THE MAINLAND
SO WE HAVE TWENTY PAGES OF COMMENTS AND WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THEM
NOW THAT WE'VE HAD THIS
IT IS ILL CONCEIVED TO APPROVE A MODEL FOR THE REOPENING OF SCHOOLS IN THE ABSENCE OF A PLAN THAT ADDRESSES THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES
THE GUIDANCE COMING OUT OF ORANGE COUNTY HEALTHCARE AGENCY WE WILL LOOK AT ALL OF THAT TO MAKE THAT FINAL DECISION
AND THEY MAY NOT BE FULL TIME IN THE VIRTUAL SCHOOL THEY MAY BE
IN FUTURE MILLIONS OF CHILDREN COULD BE SAFELY SCREENED FOR GENETIC DISORDERS IN THIS WAY
SO WHEN WE AND THESE MUTATIONS THEN WE CAN OBSERVE AS SEQUENCE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS IN THE POPULATION SO IF YOU COMPARE TWO GENOMES BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TEACHERS WHO ARE EXPERTS IN THEIR CONTENT
THEY'RE A STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING FIRM THAT SOME CONSULTING ARCHITECTS ALSO USE FOR STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING IT HAPPENS THAT STUDIO PLUS CHOSE TO USE THEM ON THE ENSIGN PROJECT
BUT THERE ARE MORE IDEAS TO DRAW SEBASTIAN IS TEACHING ANOTHER CLASS NOW I'LL DO ONE IN THE FALL
IN SOME WAYS WE'RE LOOKING AT
ALGEBRA ONE GEOMETRY AND ALGEBRA TWO
MEAN TIMES AND I'LL JUST WRITE TIMES THE NUMBER
NASA'S MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY MISSION SUCCESSFULLY LANDS CURIOSITY THE LARGEST MARS ROVER YET BUILT IN MARS' GALE CRATER
I ALWAYS SAY A DISTRICT ISN'T SUCCESSFUL BY ACCIDENT IT TAKES GREAT LEADERSHIP
SO WE WENT BACK TO SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT
THE SIGNATURE ACADEMIES
AND YET WHO COULD IMAGINE BEING LED THROUGH THOSE DAYS WITH ANYONE BUT KATHY SCOTT
POYANG LAKE CHINA'S LARGEST FRESHWATER LAKE HAS ALMOST COMPLETELY DRIED UP DUE TO A COMBINATION OF SEVERE DROUGHT AND THE IMPACT OF THE RECENTLY BUILT THREE GORGES DAM
MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE OTHER SCIENCES AND I KNOW IN COMPUTER SCIENCE WE HAVE
AND INSIDE OF IT
THE OTHER OPTION IS WHERE ALL KIDS CONTINUE TO REPORT TO SCHOOL AS THEY WOULD
THE BENEFITS FAR OUTWEIGH THE RISK
THAT WE HAVE SORT OF DEVELOPED
THEY WORKED WITH GREG WELLS PRODUCER OF ADELE AND KATY PERRY ON THEIR FIRST FULL-LENGTH ALBUM ON THE RECORD LABEL FUELED BY RAMEN
DEFINITELY PICKING UP SPEED AS A FOR PROFIT ENTITY AND THEY KIND OF
WANTS TO MAKE THAT AMENDMENT AND
NEITHER THEY NOR I HAD EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE DOING ASSIGNMENTS CORRECTLY BUT THE LACK OF SEEING THEIR TEACHER IN PERSON LEFT MOST OF THE BURDEN ON THEIR SHOULDERS
SCIENTISTS SUCCESSFULLY SEQUENCE THE TOMATO GENOME AND STATE THAT TASTIER AND MORE PESTICIDE-RESISTANT TOMATO VARIETIES CAN BE ENGINEERED FOR COMMERCIAL USE WITHIN FIVE YEARS
ONE IS DEPARTMENT SO SOMETIMES STUDENTS GET CONFUSED BY THIS BECAUSE THEY THINK THE VIEW AGREEMENT BY DEPARTMENT MEANS ALL THE COURSES THEY HAVE TO TAKE TO TRANSFER
NINE PEOPLE WERE KILLED FROM THE FLOODING THOUGH DAMAGE WAS RELATIVELY MINIMAL
PHYSICAL SPEECH AND MENTAL HEALTH THERAPY AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AMONG OTHER BENEFITS
TRUSTEE SNELL WE ARE VERY PROUD IN THIS DISTRICT
ON APRIL TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY ONE PILOTS PERFORMED CAR RADIO ON LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS
SO WHY
WEDNESDAY THURSDAY
THE LAKE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN UNCOVERED FOR OVER FIFTEEN MILLION YEARS MAY HARBOUR A UNIQUE PREHISTORIC ECOSYSTEM
TRUSTEE ANDERSON
WE OF COURSE ARE GONNA UTILIZE OUR MPR AS MUCH AS WE CAN PHYSICALLY DISTANCE
IS APPROXIMATELY TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE START OF THE SCHOOL
AND MIX IN SOUTHEAST ASIA SOMEWHERE WITH DENISOVANS AND CONTINUE OUT IN THE PACIFIC
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO A STAFFING ADJUSTMENT AT THAT SCHOOL AND IT IT SHIFTS TO THIS SCHOOL
TO DO THIS
ALL OF THESE THINGS HAVE NOT YET BEEN WORKED OUT
IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN THIS TIME AROUND I BELIEVE PARENTS WOULD EXPECT THEIR KIDS TO BE ENGAGED IN ALL DAY ONLINE LEARNING FACILITATED BY THEIR CHILD'S TEACHER
PLACE THE RESOLUTION ON THE AGENDA
AND THE ONLY SORT OF TRICKY PIECE HERE IS THAT YOU DON'T WANT THE UNTRUSTED CODE TO JUMP INTO THE SPRINGBOARD ITSELF
REMARKABLY THERE ARE NO DESCRIPTIONS OF THE OPTIONAL ACTIVITIES THAT STUDENTS WILL BE ENGAGED IN FOR HALF THE TIME THEY'RE ON CAMPUS
KIDS GO EVERY DAY AND THE NEXT WEEK THEY GO FOUR DAYS THAT'S ANOTHER
AND SO ON
IMAGINE IF WE HAVE TO FLIP FLOP BETWEEN HYBRID AND ONLINE LEARNING FOR ALL STUDENTS IN A SUDDEN TRANSITION LIKE THE ONE WE EXPERIENCED IN MARCH
HOW WILL THEY BE SEPARATED FROM ONE ANOTHER AND TEACHERS AND STAFF
OUTLINED THAT
THOSE PEOPLE OUTSIDE AFRICA HAVE LESS GENETIC VARIATION
COMMENT FROM AMY CAULFIELD
I LIKE TO THINK THAT THE ACRONYM ACTUALLY STANDS FOR MASSIVELY OVERHYPED ONLINE COURSE
BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE OK WITH IT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE INTO A POINT IN THE TRUSTED SERVICE RUNTIME THAT IS EXPECTING THESE JUMPS
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO DO I KNOW AND WE DO APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND DR NAVARRO ALL THE BEST IT'S BEEN GREAT WORKING WITH YOU AND
MISS BARTO
CHILDREN THIS AGE SHOULD NOT BE LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES FOR HALF OF EVERY DAY
MAYBE SOME OF THE TEACHERS THAT ARE AT A HIGHER RISK COULD BE THE TEACHERS FOR THE VIRTUAL LEARNING PROGRAM
QUOTE
MY EARLY YEARS AS A TEACHER
THE FLOODING DAMAGED MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND HOUSES LEAVING AROUND EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND HOMELESS AND FORCING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO EVACUATE
I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE
YES
SO WITH THE TEAM TALKING ABOUT WELL WHAT IF THIS AND WHAT IF THAT
PARENTS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO A DISTRICT OR CHARTER SCHOOL THAT WILL PROVIDE THE EDUCATION
OR WILL PARENTS SIMPLY GET A REPEATED VAGUE HIPAA COMPLIANT LETTER OF YOUR CHILD MAY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED
WHAT'S FOUR TIMES SIX THAT'S TWENTY FOUR
YOU'RE ON MUTE
A RESOURCE TO NEW AND VETERAN TEACHERS AND TO THE THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS I HAVE NURTURED AND EDUCATED DURING MY ENJOYABLE TENURE
I WOULD LOVE IF WE MOVED THAT TO TUESDAY AS WELL
YES
WAS A SOILS ENVIRONMENTAL TEST DONE WHO PERFORMED IT
AT ALL
HAVING THE CHILDREN LEARN FROM HOME IS NOT AN OPTION FOR OUR FAMILY BECAUSE OUR BOYS WILL BE HOME ALONE EVERY DAY
IN ALL MITCH KILLED THREE PEOPLE ON JAMAICA
I HAVE NO ISSUE WITH THE FEAR OF THE CURRENT STATED PANDEMIC
NO MORE QUESTIONS SO MR LEE-SUNG YOU WANT TO CONTINUE
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY

801.YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME IN LIKE A CODED WAY
802.BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY AFRAID OF EMOTIONAL INTIMACY
803.SO LOUISE HAY
804.I WAS LIKE
805.AND I REALIZED THAT LATER ON
806.AND AS I WAS DOING THE CATERPILLAR I THOUGHT
807.THE GAPS IN TIME
808.THAT'S FANTASTIC
809.I FEEL FREE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIFTEEN YEARS I LOVE MY BOOBIES BY THE WAY
810.OF THEIR
811.YOU KNOW
812.SADLY I'M NOT A PART OF THAT RIGHT NOW THEY WERE LAST IN TOUCH ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO
813.UM OK SO KEEPING YOUR TEETH CLEAN IS DIFFERENT IN PRISON AND SO IS GETTING THE WRINKLES OUT OF YOUR CLOTHES
814.ALL OF THOSE THINGS WHICH MAKE US WHO WE ARE
815.TOM RISKED GETTING IN TROUBLE AND LET JOHN ACCESS THE LAB WHEN HE WANTED
816.YOU KNOW
817.AND IT HAS BEEN FOR YEARS
818.THIS IS WEEKS AFTER I'D MET RETA AT PROBATE COURT AND SHE DECLINED TO DO AN INTERVIEW A WHOLE SEPARATE TRIP
819.THEIR POSTURE'S REALLY SLOUCHED AND YOU KNOW AT THE END OF A MEETING
820.SO YOU COULD STILL SUPPORT HIM HE COULD STILL BE THE FATHER
821.YOU KNOW AS A CHILD YOU DON'T KNOW THAT SEXUAL ABUSE IS WRONG
822.LIKE JOHN B
823.BUT YOU CAN BE OKAY WITHOUT EXPERIENCING JOY AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT THIS PODCAST TO ACCOMPLISH IS TO SAY IT'S OKAY TO HAVE SAD DAYS
824.AND YOU CAN MAKE AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO MAKE OF THAT
825.OKAY
826.AND SAY GODDAMN YOU GILMARTIN
827.THAT
828.AND
829.KIDS ARE WAY MORE INTELLIGENT
830.WHAT WAS IT LIKE FOR YOU
831.ALRIGHT COME BACK AND MEET ME AT THIS SPOT BEFORE THE NEXT PERIOD
832.WELL WHERE WAS ELIJAH THE ENTIRE THREE HOURS WE WERE THERE
833.AND
834.EVER BEEN THE VICTIM OF SEXUAL ABUSE SOME STUFF HAPPENED BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT COUNTS
835.YOU KNOW WHERE WAS THAT ANGER AND PASSION WHEN I WAS A CHILD
836.IF YOU GOT WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR CHRISTMAS OR WHATEVER AND I SAID I DON'T WANT ANYTHING FROM YOU BUT THIS IS WHAT I WANT I KNOW SHE HAD NOT PAID MY FATHER
837.THERE'S A LOT OF TOPICS I FEEL LIKE WE NEED
838.IT'S SO COMPELLING BECAUSE YOU JUST THINK HOW THE FUCK ARE THEY DOING THAT
839.YOU KNOW ANY OF THAT
840.IN FACT
841.HOW DO YOU FEEL AFTER WRITING THESE THINGS DOWN ASHAMED THAT I DON'T HAVE THE WILLPOWER TO MAKE EVEN THE SMALLEST CHANGES REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH THERAPY I HAVE OKAY SO YOU HAVE BEEN TO THERAPY
842.OR DO GET YOU KNOW
843.SO
844.FOR ME HE MADE SUCH AN IMPACT AND THE PEOPLE
845.HE HAD THIS KNOWING LOOK THAT SAID
846.AND I WAS LIKE NO ONE DESERVES THAT MANY CHANCES
847.I LOVE THE SOUND OF PERFECT SILENCE
848.AND MY ANGER
849.MAYBE TEN PERCENT OF THE SURVIVORS I'VE TALKED TO
850.THIS WOULD BE LIKE THIS IS WHO YOU NEED TO CALL AND CONTACT
851.ABOUT SEXUAL BIAS HAVING ALL OF MY RELATIVES REFER TO MY PAST BOYFRIENDS AS MY FRIEND OR BUDDY
852.HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MUCH OF THE SUSPICION
853.YOU CAN BE PATIENT WITH THEM BECAUSE IT'S A PROCESS FOR MANY PEOPLE
854.NICOLE HAS A BOYFRIEND IN A PRISON IN TEXAS WHERE THEY'VE ACTUALLY EXTENDED THE PHONE HOURS LATE INTO THE NIGHT THAT SOUNDS GOOD RIGHT
855.I HAVE A PANIC ATTACK ANYTIME I'M IN PUBLIC I NEVER FEEL LIKE MY OLD SELF WHEN I'M OUT IN THE WORLD I HATE WHO I'VE BECOME
856.AND SHE WRITES
857.YOU KNOW
858.YOU KNOW
859.THAT'S A FIVE PETE
860.ANY POSITIVE EXPERIENCES WITH THE ABUSERS
861.BUT THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THEY WERE ALL FRIENDS OF JOHN B MCLEMORE'S
862.I'M IN OVER MY HEAD AND I CAN'T BREATHE
863.I FELT LIKE EVERY STAR AND PERSON AND MOLECULE IN THE UNIVERSE WAS RIGHT
864.AT THE TIME OF THIS RECORDING IT HASN'T AIRED YET
865.AND I CALLED HER AND I JUST SAID YOU KNOW LOOK
866.JUST TRY IT
867.YOU KNOW ANGER AND SADNESS ARE
868.YOU KNOW RYAN HAD SO MANY SO MUCH LOVE FROM PEOPLE OTHER THAN HIS MOM ABSOLUTELY
869.IN SEVEN YEARS
870.WITH YOUR DAUGHTER AND WITH YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HER NOW I KNOW I'M NOT A THERAPIST BUT I
871.THE WHOLE FIGHT HAD TO DO WITH MY FEELING TAKEN FOR GRANTED AND HIS ADMITTING THAT HE HAS PROMISED HE WOULD DO BETTER ABOUT APPRECIATING ME
872.IS
873.ANY COMMENTS TO MAKE THE PODCAST BETTER TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A GUITAR SOLO NOW AND THEN
874.THERE'S A SPECIFICITY TO EACH ONE BUT I WOULD FEEL COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE GOING TO A TWELVE STEP PROGRAM
875.AND PLEASE TALK TO SOMEONE ABOUT WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH
876.SO DID YOUR DAD TELL YOU
877.WAS THAT YOU JUST YES-AND'ING OR IS THAT THE TRUTH
878.MAYBE I SHOULDN'T MESS WITH HIM SO MUCH AND SHE CALLED MY FATHER
879.HAVING CONVERTED SOME TO GOLD
880.I FELT THAT RUSH OF ADRENALINE GO THROUGH MY BODY
881.FIFTEEN I LEFT HOME I LEFT HOME AT FIFTEEN OK
882.JANUARY FIRST
883.AND HER EPISODE ON THIS PODCAST IS ALL ABOUT EMOTIONAL NEGLECT
884.WAITING THIS LONG HAS ALLOWED ME TO BE FULLY AWARE OF JUST HOW TREMENDOUSLY HEALING THE ACT OF REPORTING TO AUTHORITIES IS IN AND OF ITSELF
885.SELF-PARENTING IS HUGE TREAT YOURSELF LIKE THE NEGLECTED WEATHERED
886.I TURNED AND ASKED IF HE THOUGHT HIS HUSBAND WOULD MIND MY USING HIM AS AN ARMREST
887.AND THAT MADE IT SEEM AS IF SHE WAS ACTUALLY THERE WITH ME
888.THE LOOK ON HIS FACE WAS SHEER PANIC AND CONFUSION
889.FIFTY YEARS TO LIFE
890.WHICH CAUSED ME TO BE THIS CLASSIC OVERACHIEVER
891.GAY
892.THAT DEFINITELY SOUNDS LIKE THIS DUDE WAS GETTIN' OFF ON SOMETHING
893.IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO REPEAT AS AN ADULT BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT IT'S COMPLETELY NORMAL
894.AND ANXIOUS
895.THANK YOU FOR THAT
896.SQUAT AND COUGH
897.OR
898.BUT STARVING YOURSELF ISN'T SOMETHING YOU CAN MAINTAIN
899.I MEAN WHO KNOWS BUT THAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE TYPE OF MONEY THAT COULD POTENTIALLY AMASS TO A BOUNTIFUL HIDDEN TREASURE
900.AND EVEN IN THE TRAILER

AND EVEN AS AN ADULT
FOR IT TO ESCALATE TO THAT POINT BUT WHEN IT BECOMES OUT OF CONTROL
THAT AND
I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S EVER ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN BUT YOU ALWAYS SEEM TO LISTEN
AND YOU REALIZE OH YEAH
THEY ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED MY BIRTHDAYS BROUGHT ME PRESENTS ON CHRISTMAS TOOK ME ON ROAD TRIPS AND ALL OF THAT AND YES
ANYWAY I WAS FINALLY MYSELF IN FRONT OF STRANGERS IT WAS A HUGE STEP FOR ME AS ONLY MY CLOSEST FRIENDS HAVE SEEN ME BE MY FEMALE SELF
AWKWARDLY
SO
TO MAKE IT AN EFFECTIVE ACNE BAR YOU NEED SOMETHING TO EXFOLIATE THE SKIN
AND SOME ANXIETY BUT MOSTLY JUST REGULAR OLD BAD PATTERNS
AND YET THIS TIME I FELT ANNOYED AND THEN SO VERY THANKFUL LIKE I HADN'T REALIZED HOW MUCH I MISSED THOSE ANNOYING PHONE CALLS ABOUT MADONNA
I WAS SO LOST IN WHETHER OR NOT THAT LAST JOKE WENT OVER FORGOT MY EMAIL ADDRESS
BEATEN WHEN YOU'RE A SMALL CHILD BY SOMEONE WHO'S RAGING AT YOU
HOPE IS A DANGEROUS THING WHEN YOU'VE BEEN ABUSED
MAYBE I DON'T HAVE TO BE SUCH A FUCKFACE
IT'S A FREAKING DISH
AND IT WOULD BE JUST LIKE
AND ANOTHER ABOUT A JOB THAT WAS SO DIFFICULT THAT JOHN STARTED CRYING AS HE WAS HUNCHED OVER IN HIS SHOP AND SAID I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE
UM LET'S SEE THE CURRENT OLD
IT'S FRENCH
HELLO
I'M GOING BUT IT WILL MAKE ME PHYSICALLY SICK AND PROBABLY TAKE WEEKS TO RECOVER
I SNUCK OUT AND GOT REALLY HIGH WE WERE IN HIS CAR HE SUGGESTED THAT WE MOVE TO THE BACK SEATS
ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNGER LISTENERS ALSO BECAUSE OF THE SUBJECT MATTER
GRAHAM GOT FIRED FROM MUSHA WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN
MY FEELINGS WERE VERY MIXED BUT I THOUGHT IF I DIDN'T GO I WOULD ALWAYS WONDER IF I COULD HAVE SOMEHOW FORMED A RELATIONSHIP OR CONNECTED WITH MY FATHER IN SOME REAL WAY
SURVEYS
AND YEAH
I HAVE SO MUCH MORE ENERGY THAN WHEN THERE'S THE COMPETITION
SO HE'D NEVER SEEN THIS TYPE OF GATHERING PALLET IN WORKING ORDER AND WHEN HE LOOKED FOR DIAGRAMS OF IT
AND THEN YOU'RE LETTING IT SHIT OVER THE OTHER THINGS THAT COULD BE POSITIVE IN THE DAY TODAY TOO EXACTLY
ALL I EVER WANTED TO SAY WHAT'S I'M SORRY
THIS IS A SHAME AND SECRETS SURVEY FILLED OUT BY RICHARD LAMBERT
I STOP BREATHING IN THE RING
SHE DROVE OVER IMMEDIATELY AND DIDN'T MAKE ME TELL HER WHAT WAS WRONG
THE MOVIES WERE MOSTLY SERIOUS MOVIES BUT NOT ALL OF THEM SISTER ACT TWO BUT NOT ONE
THANK YOU
ONE OF THE
YOU KNOW THAT EMPTINESS THAT SADNESS THAT LOSS YOU KNOW
AND I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY ABUSED BY THEIR MOTHERS
I KNOW THAT PROBABLY SOUNDS FUCKED UP BUT I THINK OTHERS
DEREK WAS MY TWIN BROTHER WHO SHE WAS LIKE
HIERARCHY
IT'S JUST THE WAY SOME PEOPLE COMMUNICATE AND IT DOESN'T STAND OUT FOR ME ANYMORE
WE HAVE TO REWRITE THE CONSTITUTION
MY DOG LICKING MY FACE WRITING PLAYING TAG OR HIDE-AND-SEEK WITH MY NEIGHBOR'S KIDS
EVER BEEN THE VICTIM OF SEXUAL ABUSE SOME STUFF HAPPENED BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT COUNTS
PURPLE
BUT IF YOU WANT TO TRAVEL TEN CELLS DOWN THE TIER
THIS HAS CLEARLY AFFECTED OTHER PARTS OF MY LIFE FOR INSTANCE MY WONDERFUL AND BELOVED HUSBAND AND I HAVEN'T HAD SEX IN A FEW YEARS YES YEARS
AND FILLED WITH KOBE BRYANT
I DON'T TELL HIM BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY TALK MUCH NOW HE'S ALSO OLDER AND CHILLED OUT NOW
WINK
YOU KNOW FLY BELOW THE RADAR AND EVEN MY THERAPIST WAS SAYING YOU KNOW
BUT I WILL SAY FOR SOMEONE NOT BEING VERY ATHLETIC GROWING UP IT IS A HUGE SOURCE OF SELF-ESTEEM AND GOAL-SETTING AND GOOD TIME BY MYSELF AND IT HAS A LOT OF REALLY REALLY GOOD THINGS
I USED TO CARRY AROUND THIS CLEAR PLASTIC BEAD
THAT
WOULD YOU HAVE CELLED WITH A SEX OFFENDER THE FIRST TIME I WENT TO PRISON
AND THEN BEING ABLE TO EMBRACE FOR THE HUG ON THE RELEASE IT'S ALMOST LIKE BREATHING BREATHE IN BREATHE OUT YOU KNOW SAY IT
IF YOU HAVE BEEN ABUSED ARE THERE ANY POSITIVE EXPERIENCES WITH THE ABUSER AND DOES THAT COMPLICATE YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT THEM
SO
AND THIS CRIME IS REALLY HARD TO DEAL WITH
BECAUSE TWO PEOPLE WHO RAPED ME WILL BE HONORED GUESTS THERE
CONSIDERATE
SOMETIMES IN COLLEGE WHEN JOHN CAME INTO TOM'S OFFICE IN THE AFTERNOON FOR ONE OF THEIR BLACKBOARD SESSIONS
YOU KNOW
I WAS PROBABLY A PAIN IN THE ASS I WOULD'VE HATED TO HAVE HAD TO COACH ME
YOU CAN'T MOVE FORWARD WITH IT AND THE FIRST TWO YEARS I STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE STUFF THAT HAPPENED TO ME
BUT WE DID WANT TO ASK HIM WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT LIFE IN PRISON WHEN YOU'RE A SEX OFFENDER
AND AH
IT TOOK ME YEARS OF BEING SCARED TO LET GO OF OF TRUE
OH WHAT A DICK WHAT A CUNT
I'VE HELPED OUT VERY LITTLE AND I FEEL GUILT ABOUT IT BUT SHE DOESN'T MAKE ME FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT BUT
AND SO YOU KNOW I WENT ON TO HAVE THIS AMAZING HOCKEY CAREER YOU KNOW
AND IN THAT MOMENT
NOPE SHE JUST WAS
I UNDERSTAND THAT
CO-PARENTING ROOMMATE RELATIONSHIP BUT THE MAGIC IS GONE TOO LITTLE TOO LATE
I MOVED OVER TO THE COUCH TO GET A FEW MORE HOURS OF SLEEP ALONE AT WHICH POINT HE CALLED OUT WHERE ARE YOU
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
KNOW WHAT I'M JUST GONNA READ I HAD ONE MORE SHAME AND SECRET SURVEY THAT IT'S JUST TOO LONG AND I DON'T
HELLO FELLOW PERV
THE SCRIPT THAT THE WORLD HAS IS OFTEN SO DIFFERENT
SO EARLONNE
HE KEEPS MENTIONING IT
LOOKING AND ASKING FOR HELP AND
I WISH I COULD EXPLAIN TO MY BROTHER WHY THERE WAS SO MUCH ANIMOSITY BETWEEN HIS FATHER AND I I WISH MY SISTER WOULD BACK ME UP AND NOT PRETEND EVERYTHING WAS FINE
AND UM YEAH I FEEL GUILTY SOMETIMES TOO ON A SUNNY DAY
OK SO LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING MORE MUNDANE WHAT'S UP
UNTIL I COULD STUMBLE AWAY ENOUGH TO GET TO MY BEDROOM AND CLOSE THE DOOR AND HOLD IT CLOSE
AND NOW I CAN SAY I APPROVE THIS STORY
I WOULD HAVE THE SAME EMOTIONAL RESPONSE TO SOMEONE THROWING ME A BIRTHDAY PARTY AND SOMEONE SHOOTING A NAIL THROUGH MY HAND WITH A NAIL GUN
AND SOME OF THEM ARE REALLY REALLY TALENTED AND THE FIGHTS ARE USUALLY VOTED FIGHT OF THE NIGHT
WHEN HE GOT BACK HE AND JOHN EMAILED A BIT
UM
TUMBLING FARTHER INTO A HOLE OF SELF-HATE AND HOPELESSNESS AND I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A HUG AND
BUT
THING THAT DEGRADES WHO THEY ARE
BUT NOT THIS OTHER STUFF

BUT THE SUMMER'S THERE ARE FUCKING AWESOME
WELL UM
YOU DON'T EVER THINK OH I WONDER IF THEY'RE JUDGING ME
THIS IS FROM A GUY WHO CALLS HIMSELF NOT THE MAN I USED TO BE HI NICE TO MEET YOU AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND UM
ALLERGIES
THAT MIGHT BE HALL OF FAME
SEXUAL FANTASIES MOST POWERFUL TO YOU I THINK I LIKE TRANSSEXUALS WITH PENISES BETTER THAN REGULAR WOMEN I ONLY HAVE ROMANTIC FANTASIES ABOUT WOMEN WITH PENISES AND WHEN I DO THINK ABOUT REAL GIRLS
AND I WAS SITTING IN MY PRISON CELL AND I WENT TO SLEEP KNOWING THAT WE WERE WAY AHEAD
FOR BUYING INTO THOSE LIES
HERE'S A LETTER ONE HUNDRED THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER
WOW I THINK IVY JUST SAID IT ALL
AND TOM COULD TELL THAT AS MUCH AS JOHN DIDN'T FIT IN AT COLLEGE
I HAD THOSE EXPERIENCES BECAUSE AS AN ADULT I'M OFTEN
I'M OKAY
OR IF YOUR NIECES HEAR THE SONGS
SO THAT'S A VERY
GET ALL THIS PHYSICAL STUFF FOR MY KID I GOTTA GET THEM STUFF'
GO FIX YOURSELF A LITTLE TEA
AND THEN I WOULD MAKE THESE ORANGE ACNE BARS
THE THOUGHT OF TAKING THE TRAIN HOME FILLED MY HEAD WITH SUCH DISGUST AND ANXIETY
TALKING ABOUT IT HELPS NOT GIVE IT AS MUCH POWER AS IT HAD
LIFE MAY BE OVER
YOU'RE INCREDIBLY HUMAN YOU'RE INCREDIBLY VIBRANT
AND AGAIN
I REMEMBER THINKING
FUCK IT
THE MAN WHO OWNED THE PLACE WALKED ME INTO THE KITCHEN TO SHOW ME HOW TO MAKE THE TEA AND FORCED ME AGAINST THE STOVE AND SHOVED HIS HANDS DOWN MY PANTS HIS HAND DOWN MY PANTS
I TELL HER THAT ACCORDING TO EVERYONE I'VE SPOKEN TO THAT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE THE CASE
I GENTLY TOOK THE LITTLE BIRD AS WE CROSSED THE STREET
AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT TURNED A LIGHT ON AND UM
THIS IS THE
THIS TRANSPORTED MY MIND BACK TO A TIME WHEN THINGS SEEMED SIMPLER AND MADE ME SMILE THE REST OF THE WAY HOME
YES SHE SAYS
I WISH MY MOTHER WOULD TELL MY BROTHER THAT I WAS ABUSED AND NEGLECTED
OF COURSE MY MIND AUTOMATICALLY WENT TO THE WORST IS THIS GUY THREATENING ME WHAT IS HIS PROBLEM AND THEN I REALIZED
I CALLED HER AND I FORGAVE HER
BONDING WITH THE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT WERE CLOSE TO MY FATHER
DARKEST SECRETS I CAN'T STAND MY BOYFRIEND HE'S THE SWEETEST
OF COURSE YOU DON'T
BUT PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD TRAUMA IN THEIR LIFE
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET MARRIED
AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS OF ME NOT EATING HOWEVER THEY FINALLY CAVED AND SAID THAT HE WAS ALLOWED TO BRING ME ONE SANDWICH A DAY
I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE IN THE TRANS COMMUNITY AND I LIKE TO SAY TRANS COMMUNITY A THIRD TIME
AND SHE WRITES
AND LIVING WITH AN ABUSIVE PERSON
OH OK
I JUST HAD LIKE THIS FEELING INSIDE THAT I WANTED TO DO IT IT'S LIKE WHAT MAKES YOU WANT TO BE AN ACTOR WRITER
ABOUT HIS LOVE ADDICTION
IN THE LOST AND FOUND BIN
AND THEN THAT WAS TERRIBLE CAUSE I'M LIKE WHERE IS HE IS HE IN THE SHU WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE'S TYLER'S THEORY ABOUT WHERE THE HIDDEN TREASURE MIGHT BE
THEY SCOLD ME FOR BEING CARELESS AND WALK OFF SHAKING THEIR HEADS
WHAT'S THAT KID DOING HERE
I'M OKAY
AND IT WAS
IF SOMETIMES I MISS HER
WHAT WE ORDERED FROM THE CAFETERIA AND HOW MUCH WE ATE WAS RECORDED
NOT EVEN TEN MINUTES AFTER MY FIRST APPOINTMENT
AND IT'S FUNNY HOW WHEN I'M REALLY RUSHING
NOT CARING ABOUT YOURSELF WHICH IS A REALLY COMMON THING FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN
I'M EARLONNE WOODS
ABOUT HER ANXIETY SHE WRITES YOU ARE ALWAYS SELFISH AND MISSING SOMETHING
CERTAIN THINGS DON'T COME BACK BUT OTHER PARTS OF MEMORY DO COME BACK
SOMEBODY HAS THAT GOLD
AFTER THAT
THEO AND TYSON SHOOK HANDS
YOU KNOW
I'M PROTECTING ANYONE WHO NEEDS PROTECTING I'M PROTECTING THEM
I FORGIVE
UM
SO
I'M GOING TO BE TOO OLD TO DO STUFF THAT I WANT TO DO STILL
LET ALONE TWENTY SIX
I'M OKAY
BUT THAT IS
EVEN THOUGH THE VICTOR WALK HAS ENDED
BUT WE HOPE THAT YOU'LL STICK WITH IT
MY PARENTS ARE HEAVY DRINKERS SO ASSUME WHAT YOU WILL FROM THAT
THAT THEN BROKE OUT IN GUNFIRE RETURN GUNFIRE AND AN ARREST YEAH
HE WANTED TO TAKE HIM OUT BOATING ON THE LAKE
WHO ALSO COMES IN TO WORK WITH THE SOUND DESIGN TEAM
FEELING SO MUCH AND SEEING A FUTURE AHEAD OF ME
YOU KNOW
AND
IT QUICKLY BECAME NOT ABOUT THAT
DISPLAYING THE SYMPTOMS
EARLONNE
SOMETIMES IT FEELS SAFER AND BETTER TO JUST THINK ABOUT THE MOMENT
A COUPLE OF TIMES I FOUND MYSELF ALLOWING HIM TO DO IT
HER LAST VISIT WITH HIM WAS NEARLY FIVE MONTHS AGO
WAS A FLEDGLING TUFTED TITMOUSE AND I NOTICED IT DIDN'T TRY TO HOP AWAY AS I DREW NEAR
THESE DAYS BUT WHAT I DO FEEL IS COMPLETE LACK OF ANY POSITIVE FEELINGS
UM
IT'S BEEN FEATURED ON FORBES WALL STREET JOURNAL TIME MAGAZINE NEW YORK TIMES
YES
I'M KILLING TWO BIRDS WITH ONE SHIT BY FERTILIZING YOUR LAWN GOOD SIR
FOR SIXTEEN YEARS
UM SO
NOTE TO SELF ANYWAY

SO
HE'S GOT ANOTHER TWENTY SEVEN YEARS BEFORE HE'S UP FOR PAROLE YOU KNOW I JUST DON'T MAKE NO PROMISES ANYMORE
IN THAT MOMENT
A MASSIVE LIKE PROTECT MYSELF MODE THE RAPE AND ITS AFTERMATH WAS A LOW POINT FOR CURTIS YEAH THE LOW POINTS
AND I WILL ONLY REALIZE IT LIKE A WEEK BEFORE I DIE LIKE OH
UM
FLEURY IS FRENCH AND SO MOST OF MY FAMILY ARE MONTREAL CANADIAN FANS AND HAVE BEEN FOR FOREVER
AND SEEING THEM IN MY REARVIEW MIRROR FLY OFF OVER THE ROOF ONE BY ONE
RIGHT
THEO PROBABLY THOUGHT I HATED HIM
AND SHE SAYS SEE WHAT COMES UP
PEOPLE
AT THAT POINT I'M SURE THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO ISOLATE YOU FROM YOUR FRIENDS
I'M ASHAMED
SO IF YOU'VE BEEN MEANING TO PICK UP AN EAR HUSTLE MUG A TEE-SHIRT OR STICKERS
AND THEN I HAVE
IS LISTED HALFWAY DOWN ON JOHN'S CONTACT LIST
AND THEN ANOTHER SURVEY
AS YOU KNOW YOU CAN DO ALL THE THINGS YOU WANT BUT ACHIEVING THINGS ISN'T GOING TO ERASE THAT THAT'S TRUE IT'S
JUST GOING TO READ PART OF IT HE IS
ANYWAY HE LEFT MY FAMILY FOR GOOD WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN IN A DRAMATIC EPISODE THAT INVOLVED FISTS SCREAMING AND SHATTERED GLASS
YOU'RE NOT ALL OVER THE PLACE BECAUSE ALL OF THIS STUFF
BUT THERE'S THIS WHOLE GROUP OF NAMES AT THE TOP WHO ARE ALL FROM OUT OF TOWN AND IN A NUMBER OF CASES OUT OF STATE OR COUNTRY
OVERCOMING
THAT WOULD BE AWESOME
SOMETIMES TWO WOMEN WITH ONE MAN
AND I THINK THE ONLY WAY TO HEAL IS TO REALLY JUST
UNFORTUNATELY IT AFFECTED ME AND MY TWO BROTHERS BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW
I COULDN'T RECALL ANYTHING
YOU KNOW AH ACNE MEDICINE DEODORANT LOTION
ANYTHING ABOUT LAZINESS OR BED
YOU KNOW
YOU KNOW NOBODY REALLY CAME TO MY
AND THEN I REALIZED
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED
AS AN ASIDE I DID BUY THE SYRUP AND I DID EAT THE WAFFLES
NO MATTER WHAT STRIDES YOU'RE MAKING TREATMENT
THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS ME FROM THE STREET
AND IT STARTED CHASING US AND WE RAN DOWN THIS ALLEY
ABOUT BOXING WOMEN AND BOXING AND HOW THEY WERE USING IT TO HELP HEAL
I STILL HATE TO SEE MY CURLY HAIR AND I'M THIRTY-NINE YEARS OLD
AND AS FAR AS WE KNOW HE'S NEVER COMMITTED ONE
THAT WEARS PEOPLE OUT
I WAIT FOR RETA IN THE RECEPTION AREA AND AS SHE AND HER HUSBAND LEAVE
I WON'T DO IT SOMETHING IS POKING A NEURON IN MY BRAIN EGGING ME ON DON'T DO IT
MY OH I FORGOT WHERE I WAS
SO OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BREAK YOUR BOYFRIEND'S HEART BY BREAKING UP WITH HIM BUT GUESS WHAT HE'S A FUCKING ADULT
JUST CRAWLING INTO BED OR LAYING DOWN ON THE
WITH MY GRANDMOTHER AND ONE OF HER SISTERS MY AUNT MARGUERITE AND THEY SAT IN COURT
KIND OF SHARED ACTIVITIES IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME I'M SUPER ACTIVE
BECAUSE I'M USING SIMPLE CLEAR
I ALSO THINK ABOUT CUTTING AGAIN THE AMOUNT OF TIMES I'VE HELD A KNIFE OR A BOX CUTTER TO ANY PART OF MY BODY AND PRAYED THAT I COULD DO IT SCARES ME
UM
HE LEFT WHEN I WAS ABOUT FOURTEEN AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE MY MOTHER WAS OBLIVIOUS TO ALL OF THIS AND HAS NEVER SAID A WORD ABOUT IT
BUT NOT FOR THE REASON I THOUGHT SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID
PLAYED WITH A LOT OF ANGER
YOU DON'T
CAUSE WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU FUCKING SUCKS
I SHARE TOO MUCH ON THIS
OUR FRIEND STEVE CHAMPION HAS BEEN SICK TOO
FROM BRUSHING MY TEETH TO SEEING MY THERAPIST TO GETTING TO MY MARTIAL ARTS CLASS
DAD CURTIS OR WHATEVER
WE FUCKED ALL OVER THE APARTMENT TOOK A BREAK TO GO DOWNSTAIRS TO THE BAR
DO ANY NEVER BEEN ARRESTED KNOCK ON WOOD I'VE BEEN HANDCUFFED BUT TALKED MY WAY OUT OF THAT ONE
HAVE YOU SHARED THESE THINGS WITH OTHERS I HAVEN'T SHARED ANY OF THIS BECAUSE THERE'S NO ONE I TRUST WITH IT I FEEL ASHAMED OF IT AND I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO KNOW
UM
YOU KNOW THAT SAYS A LOT TO US AS HUMAN BEINGS THAT
DID HE
EAR HUSTLE WOULD LIKE TO THANK ACTING WARDEN RON BROOMFIELD
THE DAY JOHN WOULD GO ON TO KILL HIMSELF
IT'S INSANE
THIS IS
THEY'D BE ALIVE
AFTER TALKING TO THE SEVEN PEOPLE AT THE TOP OF JOHN'S LIST
THIS IS ONE OF THE STRANGEST THINGS ABOUT PRISON LIFE AND NO ONE HAS EVER EXPLAINED THIS CLEARLY I JUST I DON'T GET IT
DON'T COMPARE YOURSELF TO RYAN'S STORY
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
EITHER ENJOYS IT OR ENJOYS YOU ENJOYING IT
THINGS
THE SAD BRAINS HOTEL AND RESORT
AND HE JUST KNEW WHAT DID THAT FEEL LIKE
I KNOW YOU DON'T JUDGE ME
I'M FEELING VERY SELF-CONSCIOUS RIGHT NOW
SO THE WHITES
OR EVEN EARLIER THAN THAT MY MOM HAS TOLD ME WHEN I WAS LIKE REALLY LITTLE TWO OR THREE
YEAH
LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY
THIS IS A HAPPY MOMENT FILLED OUT BY LAVENDER
AND IT HELPS
THAT ONE IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF AWFULSOME
BUT
MY DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY USUALLY SPIKES THE LONGER I'M AROUND THEM
AND
YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND SHIT CAN FALL THROUGH CRACKS IN A BUREAUCRACY
A PIG
AND I'M AN ALIEN BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING ON AT HOME I KNOW ISN'T RIGHT BUT I'M AN ONLY CHILD AT THE TIME
THINGS LIKE THIS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING SEVERAL TIMES A DAY
MY DAD
IT ONLY JUST THEN DAWNED ON ME HOW PERVERSE THAT WAS AND YEARS LATER HOW IT AFFECTED MY SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT
UM

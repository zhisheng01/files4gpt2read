SEXUALLY ABUSED OR HAD SOMETHING
WELL YOU DON'T DESERVE LOVE CAUSE YOU'RE TOO FAT
FORGOT I HAD SAID THAT
I THEN REALIZED
DARKEST THOUGHTS
IT'S SO HARD
THAT MOMENT
NEVER GO WRONG AND
CAUSE I
I'M TAKING YOU TO DECEPTICON
BUT THEY DON'T TEACH US MUCH
SO UM SO EVERY FEW MONTHS I WOULD JUST SEND OFF MY WRITINGS CURTIS WAS CLOSER WITH THE WIFE IN THE PEN PAL COUPLE
AND THE NEXT DAY EVERYONE WAS COMPLIMENTING ME
THE BASS WAS BOOMIN'
I WASN'T ALLOWED A PHONE IN THE WARD SO I RAN TO THE LOCAL SHOPPING CENTER WHERE I CALLED MY HUSBAND AND SAID I WASN'T GOING BACK TO THE WARD AND COULD HE COME AND COLLECT ME
THIS IS AND WE ALL ALSO
JOURNAL WOULD SAY
I SAID YES AND THEN GOT OFF THE PHONE AS SOON AS I COULD
THROUGH THESE DOORS PASS THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE ON EARTH
FIND CANDIDATES IN ANY CITY OR INDUSTRY NATIONWIDE YOU JUST POST IT ONCE AND WATCH YOUR QUALIFIED CANDIDATES ROLL IN TO ZIPRECRUITER'S EASY-TO-USE INTERFACE
I REALLY WANT TO JUST DO
UM THE GUILT OF MAYBE HURTING THEM IS TOO INTENSE THEY'RE NICE ENOUGH PEOPLE THOUGH NOT ESPECIALLY ADEPT AT BEING PARENTS
THIS IS FROM THE BODY SHAME SURVEY
THIS DEFINITELY WASN'T THE FIRST TIME I'VE NEARLY CRIED IN A GROCERY STORE
IN TREATMENT PEOPLE SAY YOU NEED TO FORGIVE YOURSELF
ARE THERE ANY SNAPSHOTS YOU CAN GIVE ME THAT ARE I'D LIKE TO USE THE WORD SNAPSHOTS ONE MORE TIME
I THOUGHT I HATED PURPLE
JOIN THE FORUM
LET'S GET TO THIS WEEK'S EPISODE
MY FAMILY WAS WEALTHY
AND
I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU
THINK SHE MEANT WHO MAYBE I'M WRONG
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SEVERAL MONTHS
AND DID HE WAS HE
AND THEN YOU HAVE THAT MOMENT WHERE THERE'S A SLO-MO BLINK AND YOU'RE LIKE
I'M SO HAPPY I SURVIVED BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK THERE WERE MANY MANY MANY TIMES WHERE
MY DOG'S SHIT EATING TRIGGERED ME INTO A FULL-BLOWN PANIC ATTACK AND METAL BREAKDOWN
WHAT DO YOU HEAR WHAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT COMES UP
EVER SINCE THEN I HAVE LOATHED MY FEMININITY
I AINT YOUR MONKEY
NOT RECEIVING I DON'T REMEMBER NO HUG
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WHAT WAS THE NAME WE GAVE IT FOR IT THE AH
IT'S TOMMY SHAKUR ROSS WHO'S CURRENTLY INCARCERATED AT SAN QUENTIN PRISON AND HAS BEEN ON OUR SHOW A FEW TIMES I'MMA BRING IT TO LIKE RELATIVELY RECENT
AND SOMEBODY COULD HOLD YOU
BUT I WAS JUST LIKE
AND SOMETIMES MY BRAIN WILL JUST FEEL FLAT
CHARLIE CLEARLY THINKS THIS MEETING IS A TERRIBLE IDEA
BEWILDERMENT
OFF OF BENZOS WITHOUT THE GUIDANCE OF A DOCTOR
IF I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE A FAILURE ALREADY I MIGHT ACTUALLY BE ABLE NOT TO STRESS OUT AT THE SMALLEST THINGS
BUT WHEN HE PAYS ATTENTION TO HIS FRIENDS AND VIDEOGAMES I FEEL SHUT OUT AND IGNORED
UM
AND AH IF YOU'RE GOING TO SHOP AT AMAZON ENTER THROUGH THE SEARCH PORTAL ON OUR HOME PAGE RIGHT HAND SIDE HALF WAY DOWN YOU CAN ALSO BUY COFFEE MUGS
YEAH IT'S
HE HAS ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION AND I HURT TOO MUCH AND MY MEDICATION HAS KILLED MY PREVIOUS
SHE WAS RAISED IN A STABLE AND SAFE ENVIRONMENT
EARLONNE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS STORY FOR OVER A YEAR
I WAS MAKING A DIFFERENCE AH THAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL
YEAH OH YEAH
AND SHE WRITES I WAS REALLY HAPPY WHEN ABOUT THREE DAYS AFTER MY FAMILY GOT OUR NEW KITTEN
YOU WOULD GET SO HUGGED AT HUGFEST I GUARANTEED BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND YOU
SCARED OF THEIR ANGER AND CONFUSED
ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE WHO IS AN ARTIST SAID
THEN SHOVE ME DOWN AGAIN
YOU HAVE TO GIVE INTO THE MOMENT RIGHT
AND THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF DEW ON THE GRASS
HERE'S A SUGGESTION
AND I DROVE DOWN THAT MOUNTAIN
SO
HONESTLY I EXPECTED EVERYBODY TO BE REALLY SCRUFFY SCRUFFY
FEELING LIKE MY HEAD IS A HOUSE WITH A COCKPIT
THAT'S GREAT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS
WE'RE LEAVING TOMORROW
SHUT UP AND READ
HOURS OF TENSE SADNESS MELTED AWAY
AND I CERTAINLY THOUGHT HE HATED ME
AND AMAZING
ON THE WEEKENDS
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT WHY AM I
LITTLE JOYS
YOU DID NOTHING WRONG
AND EVEN THOUGH YOU DECIDE TO LIVE YOU HAVE NO FRIGGIN CLUE HOW TO LIVE LIFE ON LIFE'S TERMS YOU ONLY KNOW HOW TO COPE
A SIMPLE LITTLE PILL
YOU KNOW
EVEN THOUGH MY PARENTS MADE ME AND MY BROTHER SIGN CONTRACTS WHEN WE WERE FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN DECLARING THAT THEY WERE UNFIT TO PARENT US
TO THAT POWER
ARE NOT WHO YOU ARE
IF I'M ANGRY I GET ANGRY AT MYSELF FOR BEING ANGRY
YOU'VE ASKED FOR FORGIVENESS BUT YOU DON'T HAVE REMORSE FOR TAKING THAT MAN'S LIFE YOU HAVE REMORSE FOR OTHER PARTS OF IT
IT IS ILLEGAL
A STABLE JOB THAT PAYS A LIVING WAGE
WATCHING THE SKY TURN COLORS OVER CAMPUS
AND
SO WHEN YOUR MOM SEXUALIZES YOU AND YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY LIKE
WHEN I WAS THIRTEEN I WENT TO A
RELATIONSHIP
WE DEFINITELY DO
AND THEY BOTH CAME UP
TAKE CONTROL OF SOMETHING

THIS IS A SHAME AND SECRETS SURVEY FILLED OUT BY A WOMAN WHO CALLS HERSELF INSOUCIANT STRUGGLE I THINK I'M PRONOUNCING THAT WORD RIGHT
AND
THINKING ABOUT
I GET IN THE CAR AND PARK SOMEWHERE QUIET JUST TO BE ALONE AND WORRY MYSELF
AND
CELEBRITIES PEOPLE AT WORK
THEY ALSO SAW ME IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLACE RIGHT
YOU KNOW SHE CERTAINLY HAS THE TRAITS OF IT BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHICH MEANS
YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO SAY
HOW MANY REFORMED PEOPLE ARE ROTTING AWAY WHEN THEY'RE READY TO BE RELEASED
MY TWIN BROTHER AND I WERE BOTH LIKE WE'RE ALL ABOUT DAD YOU KNOW
I COULDN'T HANDLE IT SO I ARGUED WITH HIM
I REALIZE THAT SOME ADDICTS ARE PRONE TO EXPLOITING MANIPULATING AND ABUSING OTHER PEOPLE BUT SOME ARE JUST SELF-DESTRUCTING IN A WAY THAT'S FAR MORE IMPLOSIVE THAN EXPLOSIVE
THE BEST FITNESS ANYWHERE
OPPORTUNITY TO
HE DID BECAUSE OF BEING MOLESTED AS A CHILD
YOU KNOW
IT IS
SO SHE WROTE ME A LIST OF ONE HUNDRED THINGS HER TOP ONE HUNDRED THINGS
HE SAYS WELL
HE KNEW JOHN HATED COPS AND AUTHORITY AND MIGHT NOT FORGIVE HIM FOR IT
I WAS WEARING A SUIT FOR COURT AND A HEART MONITOR MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER WAS CHECKING ME OUT FOR PANIC ATTACKS AND I HADN'T SHOWERED IN DAYS AND MY FACE WAS RED AND TEARFUL
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE THE BOND THAT WE WERE BOTH USED
BUT I THINK HE'S GONNA LIKE IT
SHE CALLED EVERYBODY IN THE FIRST FEW DAYS AFTER JOHN DIED
AND THEN THE THOUGHT CAME TO ME
MAYBE I OVER-REACTED
YEAH I KNEW I NEEDED TO GO ON MEDS
OR MAYBE I'LL MOVE TO SEATTLE
YOU GET THE TOOTHPASTE TUBE
BECAUSE I WAS TOO DUMB
HAVING THE PASSION TO PLAY MUSIC AND AND PLAYING IT SO IN ALL SERIOUSNESS
AND THOSE TIMES WHEN THEY WOULD FIGHT AND THEN IT WOULD GET QUIET AND NO ONE WOULD COME TO MY ROOM
GOOD ON YOU
HE WAS A TARGET OF CONSTANT ABUSE
DID HE TELL YOU WHERE HIS MONEY WAS HID
IT'S IT'S NOT JUST SUDDENLY
THEY NEVER GET BETTER
AND I GOTTA BE HONEST
WHICH INCLUDED PRESENTING MYSELF IN A WAY THAT WOULD BEST BENEFIT THEM
I WOULD
THIS BOYFRIEND
I WASN'T TRIPPING OUT ABOUT THE FUTURE
I SERVED TIME FOR THAT
ASK
OKAY
AND IT'S BECAUSE OF HER MOVEMENTS
LAVISHING ATTENTION ON YOU AND YOU SAW FIRE WORKS WITH THIS PERSON
THANK YOU FOR THAT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL
THERE'S MORE
TIRED
WHERE I JUST FELT RELAXED AND ENERGIZED AND HAPPY ALL AT THE SAME TIME
THEY CAME OVER AND AND
AND YOU CAN BE VULNERABLE AT THE SAME TIME IT'S LIKE WHOA YOU KNOW
I SOMETIMES FEEL IN THE RELATIONSHIP I HAVE RECENTLY BEEN
YOU KNOW THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP BUT A REALLY SCARY
LAST NIGHT I PLAYED HOCKEY AND THE GUY THAT RUNS THE RINK LET US PLAY EXTRA LONG SO IT WAS ALMOST TWO HOURS LONG AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE SUB ON EACH TEAM
THEY'VE EVEN PUT A GATE ACROSS JOHN'S DRIVEWAY WITH NO TRESPASSING SIGNS AROUND IT
THIS IS A SHAME AND SECRETS SURVEY FILLED OUT BY A GUY WHO CALLS HIMSELF FREEZE TIME
I WAS REALLY TOUCHED BY THAT AND
TOM SPENT MANY AFTERNOONS WATCHING JOHN SCRIBBLE ON THE BLACKBOARD IN HIS OFFICE
I'VE ALSO TOLD MY CLOSEST MALE FRIEND AFTER HE SORT OF QUESTIONED ME ABOUT IT
ANYWAY CONTINUING JUST SO YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF WHAT THIS GUY WAS ABOUT ONE NIGHT WHILE I WAS SLEEPING IN MY TINY ROOM I WAS WOKEN UP BY THE BLASTING SOUND OF TUBAS
STOP GOING TO THE WELL
HE'S NOT YOUR MOM WHO WAS A CHILD
I HATE TO ADMIT IT
YOU KNOW
HE SAW A CALL COME IN FROM JOHN
AND I WOULD JUST FEEL IT IN MY STOMACH
AH I WAS ORIGINALLY BORN IN BALTIMORE
HE WAS DEVASTATED
LET'S JUST LET THAT
AND IF YOU DO
AND I DROVE HOME I CAN'T DISAGREE
SO AND THEN IN THIS SITUATION WHERE I NEEDED TO BE I GUESS FOCUSING ON MYSELF
AND HE WENT RIGHT INTO THE LOCKER ROOM TO TALK TO TYSON
AND THE THING THAT THERAPISTS TELL ME IS
THAT'S STILL MY LIFE TODAY
I JUST STARTED TALKING AND BEFORE I KNEW IT I WAS TELLING THEM ALL ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD TRAUMA
THIS IS FROM THE STRUGGLE IN A SENTENCE SURVEY FILLED OUT BY ELIZABETH OZ
I'M WHAT YOU CALL AN ESSENTIAL WORKER WHO ALSO WORKS ON WEEKENDS
DELIVERING CONSEQUENCES TO A SICK PERSON WHO REFUSES TO GET HELP IS A LOVING THING TO DO
NOT SURE IF HE WAS PHYSICALLY OR EMOTIONALLY ABUSED
WHICH MADE ME THINK THAT
BUT IT'S BEEN SUNNY AND GORGEOUS FOR THE PAST FIVE DAYS IN A ROW AND THE ANXIETY AND GUILT ARE STILL THERE
YOU KNOW
GIVE IT A SHOT AND
WELL PUT
I'M ASHAMED OF MYSELF
I DON'T WANT TO KEEP YOU FROM SLEEPING HE CALLED BACK WHINILY
IT FUCKING SUCKS
AND I GAVE HIM A BUCCI BAR AND HE LOOKED AT IT AND HE'S LIKE OH THANK YOU
HOW CAN I SKATE SOMETIMES FOR TWO OR THREE HOURS AND NOT BE EXHAUSTED AND THROWING FIVE PUNCHES MOST OF WHICH MISS
I'D BEEN IN THERAPY A NUMBER OF YEARS
WE SAID EARLIER THAT DANIEL WAS NOT IN PRISON FOR A SEX CRIME
THAT IS AWESOME
FROM LISTENING
HE TELLS ME HE WANTED TO GET THIS STUFF WHICH HE SAYS IS HIS

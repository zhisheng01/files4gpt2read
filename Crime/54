DEGRADES OUR LIFE AND MAKES IT COMPLICATED AND PUSHES PEOPLE AWAY AND
A THING LIKE THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT THING YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE FLOSSING ARE IMPORTANT
HAVING THE PURGING
AND HE WAS KNOWN FOR DOING ELEMENTS OF RESTORATION THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE STILL DO
HOW DO I PHRASE THIS DELICATELY
I THINK MAYBE SHE'S NOT SURE WHAT I KNOW ALREADY
PART OF IT
I REMEMBER
UM
TO CHOOSE
I'M YOU KNOW
SO I GIVE HER CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL THAT THE AMOUNT OF EMOTIONAL UNAVAILABILITY SHOWS HOW LAZY SHE GOT WITH ME IN A SENSE OF JUST PROVIDING WHAT I NEED BUT LEAVING ME TO DO EVERYTHING ELSE
TRANS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU YOU WERE FINE LAST WEEK I CAN'T TALK TO YOU LIKE THIS
GET HELP FOR IT
LIKE A AH MAGAZINE
I'M SERVING A THIRTY ONE YEAR TO LIFE SENTENCE FOR BEING THE GETAWAY DRIVER OF AN ATTEMPTED SECOND-DEGREE ROBBERY
I TALKED ABOUT HOW I NEED A BIGGER BUDGET FOR THE PODCAST EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND EUROS
I FANTASIZE ABOUT ERASING MYSELF JUST AS EASILY
AND THUS BEGAN THE PROCESS OF LIKE HAVING FEELINGS
YOU KNOW
I'M SO AWARE IN SO MANY WAYS
THAT PERSON THAT IS USELESS
YOU NEED TO TALK TO SOMEBODY
SHE SAID YOU CAN DO THIS
LET'S GET OFF THIS ROLLER COASTER
THIS IS
I CAN DO TWELVE PAUL
AND WE BEGIN TO BELIEVE THAT THAT SCRIPT APPLIES TO THE REST OF THE WORLD OUTSIDE OF WHERE WE GREW UP
UM
MOST PERFECT
WE'RE REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT IT
CALL NO MESSAGE OR ANYTHING I'VE GOT NOTHING
AND I DON'T KNOW
WELL SINCE HE'S IN THE ROOM RIGHT ACROSS FROM YOU WHY DON'T YOU REACH OUT TO KEN BURNS
REALLY INTENSE
WERE YOU SHAMED FOR IT
JOIN THE MOVEMENT
I DIDN'T KNOW HIS NEW OBSESSION WITH MICROWAVES
AND TO WHOM HE'D GIVEN HIS FINAL INSTRUCTIONS AND CONTACT LIST ALLEN SAYS AS SOON AS SHE TOLD HIM SHE WAS WITH WOODSTOCK TOWN HALL
SO I THINK IT WAS JUST BEING PRESENT
IT'S THE THING THAT STANDS BETWEEN YOU AND HAVING MEANING AND PURPOSE
EVEN THOUGH I HADN'T SEEN HIM IN TWELVE YEARS
FOR THIS BEAD THAT YOU HAD POSSESSION OF
AND I REMEMBER SAYING YOU HAVE THE WRONG HOUSE WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
AND MAKING SURE I WAS OK
THIS IS A HAPPY MOMENT FILLED OUT BY PINKY AND SHE WRITES I CAME HOME AND FOUND MY OLD CAT SLEEPING AT THE FOOT OF MY BED COMPLETELY RELAXED
I WAS CRYING AND I WAS IT WAS JUST LIKE FAMILIAR AND DISGUSTING
WITH RICHARD PRYOR CALLED BUSTIN' LOOSE IF YOU REMEMBER THAT
TO ASK FOR HELP
YOU KNOW
KNITTING NEEDLES IN MY EARDRUMS
THROUGHOUT MY CHILDHOOD I LEARNED THAT TO KEEP THE TWO OF THEM HAPPY I HAD TO REMAIN PERFECT AT ALL COSTS
WHERE SOME OF THE MONEY IS HIDING
YES
I KNOW PROBABLY WHO YOU THINK IT IS
I'M SO SORRY AND THEN THE NEXT DAY I HAD A PASTRAMI SANDWICH PROBABLY
WHICH HE HAD TO LEARN WHEN HE FIRST GOT TO PRISON
YEAH THAT THAT'S UP THERE WITH THE NOBODY RETURNING YOUR TEXT AND YOU JUST ARE
ASHAMED AND BELITTLED AND IRRELEVANT AND I WAS REALLY SAD
AND THEN THERE'S RACE YOUR RACE MATTERS IF YOU'RE A SEX OFFENDER IN PRISON OKAY
A BREAK
THAT SINGLE MOMENT OF SOLIDARITY AND PROOF THAT SOMETHING I DID HAD STUCK
I CAN'T CONTROL THAT
THIS IS YOUR DADDY
SENDING YOU A BIG HUG
PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA
ME ON MY WAY TO THE EMERGENCY SHELTER I WALKED DOWN TO THE AVENUE THE SHELTER WAS ON TURNED THE CORNER
I DESPERATELY NEEDED AT THE TIME WAS SOME SORT OF GUIDANCE SOME SORT OF PERSON TO
I RESPONDED I'M AWAKE
EVENTUALLY SHE'LL REVEAL THAT WHEN RETA GOT INTO JOHN'S HOUSE
WE'RE SITTING IN THERE NOW TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO STOP THIS EVIL QUEEN FROM DESTROYING THE WORLD OR TRYING TO FIND AN ARTIFACT THAT'S GONNA HELP US SAVE AN ENSLAVED RACE
SO THAT'S MY THOUGHT ON BUTTHOLERY
NOT ONLY DO WE SHAME OURSELVES BUT OTHER PEOPLE SHAME US AND
HE IS STRAIGHT
ASKED HER WHY SHE WAS NOTIFYING HIM AFTER THE FUNERAL
HE DRAGGED ME THROUGH THE HOUSE BY MY HAIR AND WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE ARE YOU PRACTICING
WHY DON'T YOU TRY WRITING IT DOWN MAYBE TAKING SOME KIND OF BABY STEP
IS YOUR SEEING
AND MY REPUTATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN
YESTERDAY I WAS WALKING IN THE PARK WHERE I USED TO GO WITH MY EX-LOVER WHO DUMPED ME SUDDENLY A YEAR AGO
TRYING TO BE A SPIRITUAL PERSON
UM
IT WAS LIKE A COMA IT
BUT AT LEAST SHE'S FACING THE RIGHT DIRECTION AT LEAST FOR THOSE TWO DAYS
IT WASN'T AN INCREDIBLE OR MIND-BLOWING MOMENT IT WAS JUST A NORMAL HUMAN CONNECTION
THAT MIGHT BE HALL OF FAME
HE'S OUR SPECIAL LITTLE GUY AND THEIR HEARTS WOULD MELT
THAT IS PROFOUND
MY GOD
AT SCHOOL TEACHERS KEPT TELLING MY PARENTS THAT I'M GIFTED AND THEN MY PARENTS HAVE SINCE
I THINK THERE WAS ANOTHER PERSON IN HERE
AND IT CARRIED THROUGH TO SEVENTH GRADE
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT WHICH ONE
EVEN THOUGH I THOUGHT THAT LAST TIME AND THEN I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING AND IT DIDN'T
GIVE YOURSELF THAT VACATION YOU DESERVE IT
UM
THAT'S WHERE THE FIRST CUT COMES FROM
LIKE WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT
AND SOMETIMES IN REALITY IT'S IT'S IN A GREY AREA BUT IF YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT IT

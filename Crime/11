INVALIDATING MIND-FUCKED PRESSURE COOKER
JUST READ THE SURVEYS
AND AH
SCARED I FELT
I GUESS IT'S A UNIVERSAL THING TO SAY OR ASK FOR ME BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S SO WRONG WITH ME I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I ALWAYS COME IN LAST
AND
SUICIDE FROM THAT POINT WAS A VERY EASY STEP
I WANT YOU TO COME IF YOU DO NOT MIND WRITE ME
SO I DROVE UP THERE AT LIKE TWENTY OR SOMETHING EVERYONE WAS THERE FROM LIKE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES FOR AN ENTIRE SESSION LIKE
LIKE DANIEL AND ALIJAH WE'VE ALTERED HER VOICE
AND UM
BY YOUR FAMILY OF ORIGIN
THAT IS A T-SHIRT
SO DOES ALL THOSE MENTAL
AND I WENT TO BED
MY JOB WAS TO STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TRACK ON A DIRT MOUND AND FLIP THE CARS WHEN THEY LANDED ON THEIR BACKS
I SPIED A LITTLE SOMETHING ON THE STREET
HE HASN'T HEARD IT YET
A WHOLE LOT OF AWFULSOME
HE'S IN HIS EARLY FORTIES NOW
A DAY OR SO AFTER FINDING HIM AND PROCESSING WHAT ALL THIS MEANT I SENT HIM A MESSAGE ON THE APP
IT'S MASSIVE IT'S GOT A GIANT CASTLE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT RIGHT SITTIN' ON TOP OF A PYRAMID
I THINK YOU ARE WHAT YOU PRACTICE I DON'T PRACTICE SEXUAL DEVIANCE ANYMORE
I WANTED I DIDN'T WANT TO QUIT I JUST WANTED I WANTED TO GET BETTER
PROMPTLY FOLLOWED WITH TOOTSEE ROLL BY SIXTY NINE BOYZ
I WAS ABLE TO SEE PAST THIS ASSHOLE I KNEW I COULD FIND A BETTER SHRINK OUTSIDE OF THIS PLACE AND I DID
SHE TOLD THE POLICE OFFICERS THAT JOHN HAD SAID THERE WAS GOLD THERE
I REALIZED RIGHT THEN THAT ALL THE DREAMS I EVER HAD OF MATTERING TO HIM AND BEING DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL WERE JUST NOT EVER GOING TO BE REALITY
FATIMA I
WHERE PEOPLE ARE
QUICKLY SCREEN CANDIDATES RATE THEM AND HIRE THE RIGHT PERSON FAST IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES
BUT AT THE TIME I WAS JUST FROZEN
HOW JOHN GOT IN TOUCH WITH OUR RADIO SHOW AND THEN I STARTED INVESTIGATING SOME LOCAL GOINGS-ON WITH HIM
VULNERABILITY IS ALWAYS THE KEY
I'M ON MEDICATION FOR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION BUT SHE REFUSES TO SEEK HELP OF ANY KIND
YOU KNOW
I REMEMBER IT LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY EVEN THOUGH IT WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO
DISBELIEF THAT IT WAS REALLY OVER AND THAT I NO LONGER HAD ANYTHING TO FEAR OR DREAD
ANY POSITIVE EXPERIENCES
RAHSAAN'S CELLMATE TESTED POSITIVE
YOU KNOW ROLLING HILLS TALL TREES
OH AND THEN THERE'S SOME MORE NOTE DUE TO MIX UP OF SOME NUMBERS AND NAMES WE ASK THAT YOU KEEP YOUR WINNING INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL UNTIL YOUR CLAIM HAS BEEN PROCESSED AND YOUR MONEY REMITTED TO YOU
FIGURING OUT TECHNIQUES HE COULD USE IN HIS CLOCK RESTORATIONS
THAT WHAT I'M REALLY DOING IS
WHAT I HEAR A RASPY TASTE
I HATE IT AND DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT AT THE SAME TIME I ALSO FANTASIZE ABOUT MY EX WITH A PLEASANT PENIS COMING ALL OVER ME AND IN MY MOUTH THIS MAKES ME FEEL MORE NORMAL BUT STILL UPSET THAT I CAN'T MOVE PAST HIM
THEO HAD JUST GOTTEN BACK TO THE ICE AFTER SOME TIME IN A REHAB PROGRAM AT THE TIME
I OFTEN DRAG MYSELF THROUGH THE DAY COUNTING THE MINUTES UNTIL I CAN GO HOME AND LAY DOWN AGAIN
NEUTRAL LANGUAGE
THEN J GAVE CHRISTIANA A BIG BOX WITH DIARIES OF THE FIRST THREE YEARS AND THEN WHEN SHE'S THE DIARIES WHEN SHE HAS STAYED UP ALL NIGHT READING THESE DIARIES AS MUCH AS SHE COULD
SO I CARRY THAT VOICE WHAT WAS IT ABOUT ME
LIKE I STOOD THERE FOR PROBABLY TEN MINUTES LOOKING AT THIS AISLE THINKING
INSTEAD OF YELLING FROM
BECAUSE I WAS TALKING TO MY DAD
WHAT
THAT COULD BE AN AWFULSOME MOMENT TOO
AND IT WAS UNCHARTERED TERRITORY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO CALL IT
YEAH I'LL SAY THAT
MY BOYFRIEND AND I MADE AMENDS BUT NOW EVERYTHING IS BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE
IN THIS MOMENT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT I'M FEELING WHAT I'M FEELING HAPPENED TO ME WHEN I WAS A CHILD
ON THE ODD DAY THAT I RUN FOUR MILES I THINK HOW THE FUCK DOES SOMEBODY MAKE IT FIVE MILES
I COULD TELL HE WAS SINCERELY WOUNDED
EVEN TO THIS DAY AT THIRTY
HOW'D HE KEEP YOU FROM TELLING ANYONE
AND
DID HE TELL HER IF THERE WAS GOLD
THEY SAID OKAY I'M WITH YOU
SEEING HOW MUCH I AM MAKING HER HAND HURT AND KNOWING THERE IS SO MUCH PAIN LEFT IN ME THAT I CANNOT CRUSH INTO HER HAND
WEIRD
HAVE YOU FELT JUDGED FOR STAYING WITH HIM OH YEAH THAT WAS THE OTHER HUGE JUDGMENT WHY DID YOU STAY WHY DO YOU STAY WHY DID YOU BAIL HIM OUT
THE FIRST DAY WHICH WAS A THURSDAY MY APARTMENT BUILDING WAS OUT OF POWER FOR ALMOST TWENTY-FOUR HOURS AND I DIDN'T HAVE WATER
SO YOU SAID THAT YOUR HUSBAND WAS JUST LOOKING HE WASN'T HE WASN'T TOUCHING ANY CHILDREN
A WHY YOU MAY ASK WELL
BUT WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS AND THAT'S PART OF THE GENETICS THAT MAKE US UP IS THAT
BUILD UP A SWEAT
IS IT THAT BAD AM I EXAGGERATING SHOULD I HAVE DONE THIS WHAT IF I DID THAT
I CAN SO CLEARLY PICTURE YOUR MOM PORTRAYING HERSELF AS THE VICTIM
AND THERE'S NO SHAME IN IT
OF THESE FRIENDS
SHE DOES CONSIDER ME HER CHILD' BECAUSE I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE SHE TREATED ME LIKE ONE OF HER OWN
I LOVE THAT TOO BECAUSE THAT'S LIKE
BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAVE SHIT TO DO WITH ME
BUT EVERYBODY IN THE LEAGUE KNEW THAT THEO HAD SPENT A FEW ROUGH YEARS STRUGGLING WITH DRUGS AND ALCOHOL
YOU KNOW I JUST HAD THIS IMAGE IN MY HEAD THAT THAT IS THE LOVE THAT YOU WANTED
IF YOU'VE BEEN TAKING A LOT OF BENZOS FOR A LONG TIME PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
I ALSO BATTLE ANXIETY WHICH SHE KNOWS
IT WAS A GREY AREA
HOW DO YOU FEEL AFTER WRITING THESE THINGS DOWN LIKE I'M MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT NERVOUS ABOUT SHARING
THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT ARE
BOOK YEAH THE THING I SAY TO MYSELF A LOT OF TIMES IS WILL THIS MATTER IN FIVE YEARS
IT NEVER FELT WEIRD BECAUSE SHE WAS INTO THE SAME STUFF
I NEVER TOLD ANYONE
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO TALK TO YOU THIS LATE AND OVER A DECADE
GUILT THAT I DEPRIVED MY PARENTS OF A GRANDCHILD
WHAT MY DREAMS WERE WHAT MY GOALS WERE AND WHAT MY ASPIRATIONS WERE AND HE WAS ACTUALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO ME
YOU NAME IT
AND THEN SHE LAUGHED AND SAID MAN I HATE THAT GUY HE IS SUCH A DOUCHE
AND THE DECISION FOR HER WAS TO GO INTO MENTAL HOSPITALS AND THE DECISION FOR ME MY MOTHER DECIDED RATHER THAN SHAME HERSELF AND ADMIT TO BEING A SHIT MOTHER MAYBE RIGHT
THE NINE DAYS OF
AND HE WRITES

THE DAY I WAS LEAVING THE NORTHRIDGE QUAKE HITS
WOULD YOU GUYS PLEASE TAKE MORE
BUT THAT'S IT
THE THOUGHT IS ALMOST APPEALING I DESERVE TO SUFFER FOR FORCING MY MOM THROUGH THIS ILLNESS WITH ME
QUIT
SUDDENLY I HAD THIS INTENSE SEXUAL FANTASY OF ME BEING THAT AGE AGAIN
HE'S PLUGGED UP IN TUBES YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT WAS OVERWHELMING TO SEE THIS THIS HAPPEN
FAMILY ENVIRONMENT WHEN YOU GROW UP AS AN ADULT YOU'RE GONNA NEGLECT YOUR KIDS YOU KNOW IT'S JUST
ONE MAN TOLD ME THE STORY OF THE CLOCK THAT CEMENTED HIS AND JOHN'S FRIENDSHIP
YOU KNOW THAT IMAGE OF YOU AS THAT KID IN THAT TENSE SILENCE IN YOUR HOUSE
THANK YOU FOR THAT
THE PAST COUPLE TIMES I'VE MESSAGED YOU
BACK UPSTAIRS AFTER ANOTHER ROUND HE CALLED HER TO SAY GOODNIGHT AND TELL HER HE LOVED HER WHILE I SAT NAKED NEXT TO HIM ON THE COUCH
DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION AND I APPROVE THIS SUMMER LISTENING BONUS EPISODE THIS PODCAST WAS MADE POSSIBLE WITH SUPPORT FROM THE CHAN ZUCKERBERG INITIATIVE
IN WRITING MY SECOND BOOK I REALLY DISCOVERED WHAT MY CORE BELIEFS WERE ABOUT MYSELF RIGHT
AND THAT LET'S SAY IF YOU WERE AFRAID OF FLYING
I'VE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER THAN WHEN THEY TALKED TO ME AS A PERSON THEY DIDN'T SAY A WORD ABOUT HOW I WAS DRESSED
MERRY FUCKING CHRISTMAS
SO THIS LIST
AND SO THE FIRST CALL I MADE I MADE TO MY DAD AND I SAID HEY DAD
I WASN'T THEY WEREN'T GOING TO LET ME FALL TO MY DEATH BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT WHEN YOU'RE STANDING ON THE EDGE OF THIS GAPING THING
I SAID WHAT THE HELL
SOME TIRED BLUES RIFFS OH YEAH
I NEVER FEEL THINGS AS INTENSELY AS I DO WHEN I READ THEM OUT LOUD TO YOU GUYS
WE CAUGHT THE BEAT
STORIES FROM PEOPLE OF COLOR
WE LAUGHED
I DON'T KNOW AND ULTIMATELY
AM I MAKING SOME SMALL DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD
I'VE GOT NO ONE TO REALLY TALK TO
AND THEN DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR A TV LICENSE WHILE THEY'RE HERE
A MOMENT THAT HE HAD AH WITH THEO
BUT I WAS ALWAYS IN THE BATHROOM
BUT UM
YEAH IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE AND IT BRINGS ME BACK TO JESUS
HERBET YOU GETTING WORKED UP BUDDY
I TREATED THAT LITTLE BEAD LIKE A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY
THAT I'M VERY SAD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH JOHN
I THINK THE HUMAN CAPACITY FOR COMPARTMENTALIZATION IS LARGE AND THIS IS A CASE WHERE IT WAS IN FULL BLAST MODE
OR
MY FATHER WAS AN ABUSIVE ALCOHOLIC AND DRUG ADDICT HE WAS IN AND OUT OF MY LIFE DURING MY CHILDHOOD HE WAS AROUND JUST ENOUGH TO BREAK MY SPIRIT AND CRUSH ME WITH HIS ABANDONMENT
DISCRETION IS ADVISED
NOW TO ME THAT'S
BUT I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT MY MOTHER
THE ABUSER WAS MY MOTHER AS I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER GUY AND EVERYBODY ASSUMED IT WAS ME AND
LILIANA WRITES ABOUT BEING A SEX CRIME VICTIM
WAS IT THE TOP PEOPLE ON HIS CONTACT LIST
YOU KNOW LIKE TO POINT THE FINGER OR COMPARE
I WAS SO ATTRACTED TO HER SERENITY THAT I WANTED TO LEARN AND I WANTED TO HANG OUT WITH HER BECAUSE
I COULD HAVE BEEN ANYTHING
NOW IT JUST HAS A NAME
WOULD MEAN THE COUSINS WOULD GET CONTROL OVER THE PROPERTY AND ALL OF MARY GRACE'S AND JOHN'S BELONGINGS AND ASSETS
I JUST TOLD THEM I HAVE POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER
CAST MEMBERS THAT DON'T DRAG US BY THE HAIR OR
AN ACTIVE FATHER
LET'S LET THAT SINK IN
SHE WAS NINE
YOU KNOW TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE AND
THIS IS A STRUGGLE IN A SENTENCE FILLED OUT BY INTERNALIZED TWINKPHOBIA
SO
STILL REACHING OUT TO PEOPLE TO KEEP YOURSELF AFLOAT IN YOUR LIFE
THIS IS AN EMAIL I GOT FROM A LISTENER NAMED PAM
SHE WRITES
I DON'T WANT THIS TO TURN INTO AN EMOTIONAL AFFAIR BUT I'M AFRAID IT IS TOO LATE
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE THINGS HARDER ON THEM
AND
UM BECAUSE THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE WHICH SHE WRITES HERE
PERSON WHOSE HEART IS OPEN RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME AND THAT'S WHAT LIFE IS ALL ABOUT IS THOSE I KNOW THAT SOUNDS CLICHE BUT IT REALLY IS
LAST I HEARD SHE MAY OR MAY NOT BE HOMELESS
AND
ONLY IF YOU'RE FAT AND UGLY
SO WE ARE DOING THIS STORY ABOUT SEX OFFENDERS RIGHT
UM WITH MY FATHER IN THE SEAT NEXT TO ME
I MEAN I GUESS THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE LIKE TOUGH BITCHES OR WHATEVER BUT THE WOMEN I KNOW LIKE WE REALLY GET IT AND WE GET EACH OTHER WE WANT TO HELP EACH OTHER
AND SO SHELDON
THAT FASCINATION HADN'T DWINDLED
DISCRETION IS ADVISED
I FELT A LOT OF SHAME FOR HAVING TO
WE DANCED TOGETHER IN A SMALL CIRCLE OF THREE FOR THE ENTIRE SONG
YOU LITERALLY
AND THROUGH THAT
HE WRITES SEVERAL TIMES WHEN I WAS A PRETEEN TEN TO TWELVE BUT I MIGHT BE WRONG ON THE AGE
HE'D EVENTUALLY STOP WHEN HIS VOICE GOT HOARSE AND HE COULDN'T SCREAM ANYMORE
I WENT RIGHT TO SLEEP AGAIN
OR STARING INTO HERBERT'S BUTTHOLE
AND HER AWFULSOME MOMENT SHE WRITES
VERB
TELLING HIM HE WANTED TO COME VISIT THAT WEEK THAT NIGHT WHILE ALLEN WAS TEACHING VACATION BIBLE SCHOOL
I'VE COME TO LEARN HOW TO SAY WHAT I NEED MORE EASILY THE SECOND TIME AROUND
OCCASIONALLY EVERY THREE TO FOUR MONTHS I ISOLATE MYSELF FOR TWO TO THREE DAYS AND GET AS FUCKED UP AS POSSIBLE I WOULDN'T CALL THAT CLEAN
WHEN MY DAD WOULD SEE PEOPLE'S AWW FACE HE'D GENTLY STROKE THE SIDE OF MY HEAD AND KISS ON MY HEAD AND TELL THEM
I WAS STRESSED THAT I WOULD MISS THE PARADE AND WAS WALKING AS QUICK AS I COULD
YOU KNOW POSSIBLE ADDICTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT NEED TO WORK THROUGH AND SOME FEELINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SUPRESSED
YOU KNOW
SIX AND EIGHT
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE GROCERY STORE I MEAN THAT'S ENOUGH RIGHT THERE
YOU KNOW JOHN'S NOT THE AVERAGE PERSON
BEING THAT VULNERABLE YOU KNOW I LIKE TO THINK OF MYSELF AS SOMEBODY THAT CAN GET AS VULNERABLE
SNAPSHOT FROM HIS LIFE I TOLD MY DAD THAT I WANTED HIM TO SAY HE LOVED ME

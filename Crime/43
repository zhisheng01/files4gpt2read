YOU KNOW ALL THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING AT ONCE AND YOU'RE LIKE THERE'S THAT YOU'RE IN THE ZONE THEY CALL IT IN TENNIS THE ZONE YOU KNOW AND THAT'S HOW YOU LIKE WHEN SOMEBODY ASKS YOU HOW YOU'RE DOING
HE'S BEEN EMOTIONALLY ABUSED BUT HE'S NOT SURE IF THIS COUNTS
THAT'S THE BEST
YOU KNOW THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO RIGHT I JOKE THAT
BECAUSE WE REMEMBER IT SO DIFFERENTLY
I CRANKED THE FIRST BEER CRANKED THE SECOND BEER CRANKED THE THIRD BEER CRANKED THE FOURTH BEER AND SAT BACK AND WENT THIS IS THE GREATEST DAY OF MY LIFE
BUT THE MORE IMPORTANT APPOINTMENT TYLER'S PREPARING FOR TODAY IS AT THE BIBB COUNTY PROBATE COURT
SOME AS A SEX OFFENDER BUT HIS CLOSEST FAMILY INSISTS HE DID NOTHING
AND HAD BEEN
BECAUSE INSIDE EVERY PIECE OF SHIT IS A DIAMOND
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LOOKING GOOD AND FEELING GOOD
THE RICH ARE STILL BLAMING THE POOR
RELIEF AT FINDING THE ACTUAL PROCEDURES WAS QUICK AND SIMPLE
HE'S TYPED UP A LIST WITH THE DESCRIPTION
OF YOUR FATHER THAT IS YOU PROCESSING YOUR OWN STORY
FUCKING KEEP IT TO
YOU ARE SO AWESOME DID I JUST GET INTO YOUR HEAD
I ALWAYS HAD TO WEAR MY HEAVIEST SWEATERS AND BOOTS BECAUSE WITHOUT THEM I FELT ANXIOUS AND LIKE I WOULD FLOAT AWAY
FEAR THAT I WOULD SUFFER SO BADLY FROM POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION THAT I WOULD BE PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY INCAPABLE OF CARING FOR A BABY IF I GAVE BIRTH
AND HE STILL HAD A LOT OF STUFF YOU KNOW THAT HE HADN'T
I THOUGHT WE WOULD GO BACK HOME BUT IT DID NOT HAPPEN JUST MORE BEATINGS FOR HER I BECAME INVISIBLE
AND
HER DAD WAS LAID OFF FROM HIS JOB IN THE LAUNDRY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER IN CLOSE QUARTERS
AND I WAS LIKE
EVENTUALLY PASS OUT
WELL I DON'T' HAVE TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH I LOVED THAT
GETTING RAPED
YOU KNOW
ONE PERSON WHO'S GOING TO STAY UP ON THE GROUND TURNS THEIR BACK TO THE CREVASSE AND THE OTHER PERSON JUMPS INTO THE CREVASSE AND PULLS THE OTHER PERSON OFF THEIR FEET AND THEY HAVE TO DIG THEIR AXE IN AND THEN SET UP THE SYSTEM OF PULLEYS TO WINCH THE OTHER PERSON UP OUT OF THE CREVASSE
FRUSTRATION
WHICH INCLUDED BEING CREMATED
GRIZZLY OLD VETERAN AND SO
MESRO
I'VE GIVEN YOU AN UPDATE ABOUT WHERE I'M AT IN MY TRANSGENDER LIFE SO WHY CHANGE ANYTHING NOW
MUSCULATURE AND THINGS LIKE THAT
FORGIVE YOURSELF PLEASE FORGIVE YOURSELF
WE DECIDED WE COULD BE INTIMATE IN OTHER WAYS BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS ISN'T IDEAL FOR BOTH OF US
THAT MEAN PART OF MY BRAIN SHUTS UP
YOU KNOW
I MEAN LITERALLY THROUGH ME
BECAUSE YOU ARE PRESENT AND IT'S NOT AN EFFORT TO BE PRESENT IT'S YOU WANT TO
THIS IS A SHAME AND SECRET SURVEY
BUT ALONG THE WAY DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP
YOU KNOW THESE TEACHINGS AND PRAYER AND MEDITATION AND ALL THIS STUFF AND YOU KNOW
RECOVERY REALLY NUMBER ONE
TAKING ALL SORTS OF STUFF FROM JOHN'S HOUSE THAT THEY SAY IS NOT HIS THE BUSES AND TRAILER
CALLS HIMSELF C MARTIN JONES
HE WAS SHOWING ME THAT HE WAS WEARING THE RUBBER CAUSE BRACELETS I HAD GIVEN OUT AT THE TABLES MONTHS BEFORE
AND THAT TYPE OF SHIT ALL DAY SO OTHER FOOD IS REALLY IMPORTANT
HE SAYS HE WOULDN'T DESCRIBE HIS CHILDHOOD AS HAPPY HIS DAD LEFT HIS FAMILY WHEN ELIJAH WAS FOUR YEARS OLD
BUT SHE DOESN'T KNOW IF THEY LOOKED EITHER
DID
QUEUE IT UP TO THE PART WHERE I START READING YOUR SURVEY
THAT IS SO AWESOME THAT YOU HAVE
AND AS LONG AS IT'S NOT LIKE DRINK CAUSE I MEAN I REMEMBER TIMES WHEN THERE WAS GUYS FISHING ALCOHOL
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE OLDER
IT'S SO MUCH EASIER FOR ME TO BE COMPASSIONATE BUT I AM YOU KNOW I'M HUMAN
OKAY NOW YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT
IS THAT WHEN JOHN'S COUSIN RETA GOT INTO HIS HOUSE THREE DAYS LATER AND LOOKED IN THE FREEZER
HAVE YOU EVER FELT THAT YOU CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE NO I'VE NEVER FELT THAT I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE
HOW DO YOU FEEL AFTER WRITING THESE THINGS DOWN A LITTLE UNHINGED
A CAMP IN BRANDON MANITOBA
ABOUT HIS ANGER ISSUES I DON'T WANT TO FORGIVE PEOPLE WHO'VE WRONGED ME I WANT THEM TO SUFFER SAD BUT TRUE
THEY MAKE ME FEEL BAD FOR NOT WANTING TO SPEND TIME WITH THEM ON HOLIDAYS I COULD GO ON
YOU KNOW
AND THEN IN OCTOBER MY OTHER GRANDMOTHER DIED
OUR FRIENDSHIP WENT DOWNHILL FROM THERE BUT I KEPT COMING BACK
ABOUT ONCE A MONTH ALLEN WOULD GO VISIT AND THEY'D TROUBLESHOOT A CLOCK TOGETHER
YOU KNOW EXACTLY
SHE LOOKED BACK A FEW TIMES TO LOOK AT THE BOY AND HE DID THE SAME AS THEY WERE WALKING AWAY
LOVE ME A GOOD AWFULSOME MOMENT
ANXIETY PANIC DISORDER DEPRESSION
I'VE BEEN HAVING A ROUGH TIME LATELY AND STRUGGLING TO KEEP MY PANIC ATTACKS AT BAY NEARLY THERE A FEW STREETS AWAY I WENT INTO OUR LITTLE LOCAL GROCERY STORE TO BUY SOME KALE TO HAVE FOR LUNCH NO KALE
FIND COMFORT IN THE PODCAST BECAUSE SO OFTEN
OF HOW WE MINIMIZE OUR ABUSE
BUT I HADN'T' LOST MY JOB
SO I THINK IT WILL BE A LITTLE SAD TO HEAR MYSELF TALK ABOUT A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT I'M STILL GOING THROUGH NOW AND REALIZE THE LACK OF PROGRESS
I ALWAYS TOLD MYSELF THAT FILING CHARGES WOULDN'T CHANGE OR MAKE ANYTHING BETTER FOR ME
WHO AFTER SEEMING NOT TO HAVE DONE A VERY THOROUGH JOB CONTACTING THE PEOPLE ON JOHN'S LIST
AND THEY SAID IT'S GOING TO BE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK BEFORE TAXES
THAT PARTICULAR
AND IT WAS BASED OFF OF THE BOOK THEY WROTE WHICH IS YOU KNOW
IT'S GOT A WHOLE ROW OF BOOKSHELVES ON ONE SIDE
ALRIGHT YOU KNOW I NEVER QUESTIONED WHY NOT DEREK WHY NOT YOU KNOW ANYONE ELSE
AND THEY'RE A GREAT RESOURCE FOR COUNSELING AND UM
AND IVY WASN'T THERE WITH HER BARK AND
THEY STEPPED OUT OF THE ROOM FOR A MOMENT AND HE TOLD ME WHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING AND I HAD NO IDEA AT ALL
THEN ROUND THE CORNER AND GRAB THE THING I DROPPED PICK UP ANOTHER
BUT IN THE MOMENT
RIGHT I WAS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR MY NEXT DOPE FIX
YOU KNOW
NOT TAKE ON ALL THEIR PAIN
IT'S FUNNY WHEN I READ THESE TO MYSELF AS I PUT THE SURVEYS TOGETHER TO DO THE SHOW
AND WE DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING HIT BUT ITS BRAKES SCREECHED WHICH I THINK MEANT THAT WE HAD HIT THEM
TO UNDERSTAND HOW CURTIS GOT THREE STRIKES AND HOW HE'S BEEN DEALING WITH WHAT SEEMS TO BE A HOPELESS SITUATION
DEEPEST DARKEST THOUGHTS
I WAS SCARED TO LET THAT GO ESPECIALLY NOW BECAUSE WHAT IF I AM FUCKING WRONG
AND THE GIRL WHO WORKED THERE TRYING TO HELP
THEY DON'T HAVE TO KNOW THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH THEM JUST DON'T SPEND TIME WITH THEM
I'M A STUPID IDIOT THAT STOLE SOME MONEY

SEEING THE SUNLIGHT FILTERED THROUGH GREEN LEAVES THAT SWAY GENTLY IN A LIGHT BREEZE PLAYING PEEKABOO WITH THAT PERFECT BLUE SKY
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHO I WAS
AND IT'S JUST IT'S REALLY INTERESTING TO ME THAT OTHER KIDS GO THROUGH HORRIBLE STUFF AND THEY
CHELSEA WRITES ABOUT HER DEPRESSION
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO BE TOUCHING A BUNCH OF BULLSHIT BEFORE WE GO EAT
I WOKE THIS MORNING TO TERRIBLE LONELINESS ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION MISSING HER AND OBSESSING ABOUT HER
WITH PORN I REALLY LIKE SEEING GUYS COME INSIDE WOMEN
AND
BUT I THINK
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ANYWAYS RIGHT
I DON'T KNOW
THAT WAY I COULD TELL IT AND HAVE A BEGINNING MIDDLE END SUITE YOU KNOW
HE WAS GETTING HIS MAIL AT A PO BOX AT THE POST OFFICE
THAT THOSE THREE THINGS
WHOLE THING IT JUST IT'S VERY SUSPICIOUS
LIKE IN THAT IT'S JUST FUN TO HAVE THESE LIKE BIG BROTHERS LIKE TELLING ME WHAT TO DO IN THERE YOU KNOW
OH LET'S READ HIS SEXUAL FANTASIES I WANT TO READ THESE BECAUSE THEY'RE SO SPECIFIC WHICH I AM ALWAYS
DUDE THAT'S THAT IS SO COMMON
HERBERT
EMAILS LETTING ME KNOW
AND TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION FURTHER SIXTH GRADE IS WHEN I SORT OF GAVE UP ACADEMICALLY AND JUST WAS LIKE OKAY
I MEAN THE FILM WAS ACTUALLY AN AFTERTHOUGHT I WANTED TO BOX FIRST OF ALL
IT'S GOING WELL
YOU KNOW FOR BASICALLY I DON'T SIX MONTHS I HAD TO BASICALLY SAY NO COMMENT IN THE MEDIA AND
WHY ARE SOME CRIMES HARDER TO DEAL WITH THAN OTHERS
WHY ARE YOU WHISPERING I ASK HER DO YOU KNOW THAT GUY THERE SHE ASKS STILL UNDER HER BREATH TWITCHING HER EYES TOWARDS TYLER WHO'S RIGHT BEHIND ME TYLER I SAY YEAH SHE SAYS
AFTER BEING QUESTIONED OVER WHETHER OR NOT I WAS LYING THEY FIRED HIM
THE MINUTE THEY SAY IT
AND AH
THAT I LIVE FOR NOW ARE THE ONES THAT JUST TELL THAT PART OF MY BRAIN THAT'S ALWAYS TRYING TO TELL ME YOU BLEW IT
ON A SCALE FROM ZERO TO ONE HUNDRED
CURTIS YOU'RE LIVING IN THE PAST
IT'S NOT A BAD THING
GETTING DRUNK DOES NOT GIVE SOMEBODY ELSE THE RIGHT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU
HER BOYFRIEND CALLED TO JUST SAY
HAVE BRAINWASHED HER AGAINST HIM
TYLER SENT ME A PHOTO OF IT
THIS IS NOT A DOCTOR'S OFFICE
REFUSED TO DEAL WITH YOUR DEPRESSION
ROBBED HER BLIND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
SHE ASKED ME TO SHOW HER A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN THE OTHER ROOM THAT WE HAD SPOKEN ABOUT EARLIER
UM IN ONE RELATIONSHIP I WAS BASICALLY ISOLATED FROM MY FRIENDS AND SPENT MOST OF MY TIME WITH MY BOYFRIEND
QUOTE UNQUOTE DRINKING ENOUGH OR DOING ENOUGH DRUGS SO
ANYWAY
THAT IS HOW MY DEPRESSION WOULD EXPRESS ITSELF
I'M OKAY' BECAUSE I AM IN THAT MOMENT MOST OF THE DEPRESSION IS
THIS IS MORE LIKE A WAITING ROOM THAT DOESN'T SUCK
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL TOWN
MY SISTER ALWAYS HID IN HER ROOM AND LOCKED THE DOOR BUT I WAS STUCK WITH MY MOM
OUR FEELINGS WE SHOULD NEVER APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT WE FEEL
THE REALITY WAS LESS DRAMATIC HE WAS BAD AT SCHOOL JOHN WAS A COLLEGE DROPOUT
WHAT THAT IS LIKE
THEY'RE NOT
HE WAS TWENTY-EIGHT AS WAS MY BOYFRIEND
IF YOU'VE HAD A GUEST WHO'S SPOKEN ABOUT ABORTION
IN MY VERY FIRST PHONE CONVERSATION WITH JOHN HE HAD TOLD ME THAT ALL OF HIS FRIENDS HAD DIED OFF
KIND OF LIKE A LITTLE PIXIE
HITTING MY HEAD ON THE DOORKNOB AS I WENT DOWN
SO THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD ONE AND I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHER EPISODES YOU CAN ALWAYS
I'D BE A CHILD MOLESTER SO WHAT STOPPED YOU FROM BECOMING A MOLESTER
THAT'S WHAT WE DO ON THIS PODCAST
L'ESPRIT COMPULSIF
AND THAT WILL BE THE END OF IT
AND I TELL YOU I DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN MY LIFE
YOU KNOW THIS LAST MONTH I'VE DONE ALMOST NOTHING
SO I'LL DO SOME THINGS THAT ENABLE ME TO UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE MAKING FUN OF ME
WHAT IS THAT LIKE
THAT HE WAS ALSO DEEPLY ASHAMED OF
YOU KNOW PEOPLE DO
OR WHEN I'M WITHOUT A ROMANTIC PARTNER I ALSO BECOME LESS FOCUSED
AND I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ON MY BIRTHDAY BECAUSE I COULDN'T ASK
JUST GO NEUTRAL
I'VE PLANNED NOTHING FOR US
THERE ARE STILL REASONS FOR ME TO STAY ALIVE
HE GOT OUT OF SAN QUENTIN AT THE END OF JUNE
YOU KNOW
YOU WILL BEGIN TO BE ABLE TO SET BOUNDARIES WITH PEOPLE
RAISED IN A PRETTY DYSFUNCTIONAL ENVIRONMENT
THIS FUCKER THINKS HE CAN HAN SOLO HIS WAY OUT OF BEING A FATHER
THAT IS HEAVY
WHEN THIS ISSUE COMES UP THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED
AND I ACTUALLY WENT WAS DRIVING TO MY THERAPIST IN NEW JERSEY WHO I'D SEEN A MILLION TIMES AND I GOT LOST
FAYE STARTS MOVING HER MOUTH WITHOUT LETTING ACTUAL SOUND OUT
INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT BEING BORN INTO THE WRONG BODY
AND WE'RE STUCK IN THIS HOUSE
WELL LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR STORY YOU WERE BORN IN MANITOBA
DARKEST THOUGHTS
WOW THAT JUST REALLY REALLY MOVED ME
WE MAKE SMALL TALK
DISPROPORTIONATELY
THAT AREN'T DESCRIBED IN THAT ACRONYM
THAT'S WHY SPORTS ARE SO AWESOME YOU KNOW SPORTS OR A GOOD MOVIE
WHICH I KNOW WHO HAS THAT
THE THOUGHTS THAT POP INTO YOUR HEAD
TOM SAYS HE RECOMMENDED JOHN TO A SCHOOL COUNSELOR
THE CLIENT SIDE OF THE COUCH
BUT I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY SCARED I WAS GOING TO BRING THE VIRUS IN
YOU CAN ALSO BUY T-SHIRTS ON OUR WEBSITES YOU CAN BUY COFFEE MUGS
UM
WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN I WAS HOSPITALIZED AFTER I ATTEMPTED TO TAKE MY OWN LIFE I SPENT A WEEK IN INTENSIVE CARE

WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THIS CRIME
AND I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG
AND BECAUSE
SO WHEN YOU FIND SOMEBODY ELSE WHO'S EXPERIENCE
IT IT WAS JUST LIKE THIS
HAPPINESS THAT I HAD GOTTEN MY FUTURE BACK
I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THREE LIVES WERE CHANGED IN A SMALL WAY
AND HE WRITES I THINK ABOUT PEOPLE I LOVE DYING I THINK ABOUT BEING ALONE FOREVER I THINK ABOUT BEING VIOLENT WITH STRANGERS COMPLETELY UNPROVOKED
SHE WROTE HE SAID HE IS NOT SURE WHEN HE'LL BE ABLE TO CALL AGAIN
MY FAMILY BURST OUT INTO LAUGHTER WHILE THE DOCTORS WERE CONFUSED
NOBODY
I HAVE SHOT CRACK
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT MIKE
HOW WE FEEL ABOUT
AND IT'S NOT JUST ME BEING ME
HE KNEW
TALKED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY INTERESTED IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUES
I TOOK OUT EVERY BIT OF RAGE
I WANT TO DIE OR WHATEVER I GET A LOT OF EMAILS FROM PEOPLE OR READ SURVEYS WHERE THEY'RE LIKE I HAVE NOTHING TRAUMATIC TO POINT TO
YOU'RE SCRATCHING YOUR HEAD
MY FRIEND BRENDAN YOU KNOW BRENDAN SMALL
CITIES AND SEARCHES SO
HE WAS RAISED IN A PRETTY DYSFUNCTIONAL ENVIRONMENT
TEACHINGS THAT THEY HAD AND YOU KNOW MY CONCEPT OF GOD WAS PRETTY FUCKED UP YOU KNOW I GREW UP IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
ROCKING THE QUAD CITIES PAUL YOU'RE A PIECE OF SHIT
LIKE FOUR OR FIVE TIMES A WEEK
ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER A BOTTLE OF SHAMPOO FOR SMALL RODENTS THAT SHE HAD BOUGHT AT THE PET STORE I WENT TO THE SHOEBOX WHERE THE SQUIRREL WAS TUCKED IN I PETTED IT WITH THE BACK OF MY FINGER AND IT WAS COLD TO THE TOUCH
THERE IS BALANCE
YOU KNOW I NEEDED TO HELP THIS KID OUT I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO GET BEAT UP BY THIS STUPID FUCKING ASSHOLE
AND SHE SAID IS IT YOURS IS IT SEWED IN OR IS IT GLUED IN WHAT IS IT
BUT THIS IS VERY EXCITING
WHO ONE TIME
I THINK SO WELL YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT LIVE WITH BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER
EITHER THROUGH
AND I WAS LIKE ARE YOU KIDDING WHO WOULD TAKE THAT JOB BYE
WHO KNOWS
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO YOU SAY
REMIND THEM THAT THEY'RE NOT ALONE
HER VOICE GETS EVEN QUIETER
CAUSE WE NEED TO OPEN A T-SHIRT STORE
I NEED MORE THERAPY
IF YOU COULD GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO MISOPHONIA NOT TOO LOUDLY AS THE NOISE MIGHT BOTHER SOME IT MIGHT HELP SOME PEOPLE TO FEEL LESS ALONE
WE HAD A VOICE CALL WHILE I WAS SOBBING AND DESPERATELY TRYING TO EXPLAIN ALL THAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT
AND I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE THANKFUL TO HAVE
MAYBE IT'S A CLUE
ONE TIME SHE RAN OUT IN THE STREET AND TRIED TO GET HIT BY A CAR RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME OH JESUS
CONTINUING
BUT SHE DID HAVE A DAUGHTER MY MOTHER HAD A SISTER WHO DIED OF I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS DURING OR JUST AFTER BIRTH
IT WAS ALMOST THERE IT WAS RIGHT ON THE CUSP OF IT YOU KNOW I GET A LOT OF
MY GRANDMOTHER WAS A RACIST
LOST KIDS WHO BECAME MEN
JOHN SAW THAT COMING ALLEN SAYS
IT'S SUCH A FUCKING WASTE
AND THAT I COULD START TO HEAL NOW
YOU CAN GO GET CHALK THEY GIVE YOU ANY COLOR YOU WANT LIME YELLOW PINK
MY DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY ARE NOW HIS LIFELONG STRUGGLES TOO
NOTHING
HE GOT TO THE PHARMACY SECTION AND HE KIND OF FREAKED OUT I STILL FREAK OUT AT MENUS SO I UNDERSTAND
AND FIRST I WANTED TO GO TO WHOLE FOODS AND GET LIKE A TURKEY AND GOAT CHEESE SANDWICH
HE WAS ABSOLUTELY EMOTIONALLY ABUSIVE THOUGH HE WOULD TELL ME THAT NO ONE ELSE WOULD EVER LOVE ME EXCEPT FOR HIM BY THE WAY IF ANYONE EVER SAYS THAT TO YOU
THIS IS REAL LIFE AND NOT A FAIRYTALE STORY
WHAT ABOUT JUST READING THAT EXACT SENTENCE TO HER
AND THEN HE'S SEEING PROSTITUTES ON THE SIDE
TRAUMA MANIFESTING AS DRUG ABUSE DRUG ABUSE MANIFESTING AS COLD TURKEY AND COLD TURKEY MANIFESTING AS DIARRHEA
YOU'RE OFF AND RUNNING
AND YOU COULD CRY
NOW I FIND THAT PEOPLE SWEARING JUST WASHES OVER ME
THAT'S REALLY COOL I WANTED TO READ THIS SURVEY BECAUSE IT IS THE MOST CONCISE SHAME AND SECRETS SURVEY EVER FILLED OUT
NICEST MOST UNDERSTANDING PERSON BUT I PUSH HIM AWAY
ARE TWO REAL VERY RAW AND STRONG EMOTIONS AND
AND MY RENT AND YOU KNOW SOME ALLOWANCE SURE OKAY
YOU CAN TELL THEM THAT YOU LOVE THEM
AND AH
THAT JUST CUT RIGHT TO THE CENTRE OF ME
SHE WOULD DO IT IN THE HOPES THAT I WOULD WAKE UP AND ASK FOR FORGIVENESS FROM HER
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT THAT THAT MUST BE
I HAD NO IDEA SHE'D BE IN TOWN AND NOW I'M AFRAID SHE MIGHT THINK I'M STALKING HER SO I ASKED THE FRONT DESK WHICH ROOM SHE AND HER HUSBAND ARE IN FOUR ROOMS DOWN FROM MINE AND WRITE HER A NOTE WHICH I SLIP UNDER HER DOOR
IF YOU ARE READING THIS PARENTS
THE WIND WAS FUNNELING PAST US AS WE BOTH SANG OUT IN SPANISH AT THE TOP OF OUR LUNGS
HE WAS OPEN AND HONEST WITH HER AND HE TOLD HER ABOUT THE YOUNGER BOYS AND SHE REPORTED IT SHE WAS LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO REPORT IT
WHY AM I HAVING A HARD TIME SAYING GOOD-BYE
AND HONESTLY E
AND WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE
OUT
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STUFF THAT DISTRACTS US AND STUFF THAT CONSUMES US RIGHT
BUT YOU CAN THINK OF ALL THOSE LITTLE LIKE
RETA SUSPECTS THAT JOHN HAD MONEY OR GOLD HIDDEN SOMEWHERE
UM
MY DEAREST DARLING
SHE STEPPED OUT ONTO THE SIDEWALK AND ME AND MY DRUNK DAD STOOD IN THE DOORWAY AS MY MOM SNAPPED THE PICTURE
AND THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT THE EMOTIONS THAT THIS PERSON IS EXPERIENCING ARE NUCLEAR
IT JUST MAKES ME SO INCREDIBLY SAD
STRUGGLE IN A SENTENCE FILLED OUT BY
I DIDN'T GIVE IT HONESTLY
OR USE ME AS THE BUTT OF A JOKE I'M JUST ALWAYS ANGRY AND ON THE EDGE
THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OR SOMEBODY'S GOING TO GET HURT OR IF WE YOU KNOW ACT THIS WAY THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
YOUR MOM HAS HER HOOKS IN YOU
ABOUT LIVING WITH AN ABUSER A THOUSAND PAPER CUTS
A DEAD ANIMAL
I FINISHED MY BUSINESS MUCH TO THE FAMILY'S HORROR

NO WEAPON AFTER I GOT CAUGHT FOR STEALING THE FORTY DOLLARS I PLED GUILTY TO BURGLARY ROBBERY AND THEY GAVE ME FIFTY YEARS TO LIFE
THE GOBLIN IN THE SEVENTH STORY WINDOW WRITES ABOUT HER LOVE ADDICTION
BACK TO BIBB COUNTY
I NEEDED TO HEAR THAT
ABOUT
DEFINITELY
I HAD TO LEARN TO BE ALONE WITH MYSELF AND BE OKAY WITH THAT
I THREW A BAG OF MY SIBLINGS' TOYS OUT OF FRUSTRATION AND THEY WENT EVERYWHERE
LIVING WITH HER WAS COMPLETE CHAOS AND CONFUSION ALL THE WHILE APPEARING NORMAL TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH
FILLED OUT BY A WOMAN WHO CALLS HERSELF I LOVE THIS KID
YOU GET IT FROM PLAYERS FANS COACHES
WHEN YOU'RE DEPRESSED IN THE FALL THAT JUST FEELS LIKE
I WILL LET YOU KNOW
TO THIS DAY I DON'T BELIEVE MY PARENTS KNOW ABOUT THE ABUSE
YOU'D BE FUCKING LIVID
AND AFTER COBRA RAN OUT
AND YOU THINK FUCK I GOTTA DO THIS FOR LIKE ANOTHER HOPEFULLY ANOTHER THIRTY-SEVEN AND
FOR PATREON IF YOU'D LIKE TO SUPPORT THE SHOW THAT WAY
AND WHEN THE BALL GETS INTO HIS HANDS
HE WRITES
DEAREST CHRISTIANA THIS IS YOUR DAD
NO HYDROGENATED OILS
YOU KNOW I WE'RE ONE OF MY BROTHERS WENT AND GOT THE NEIGHBOR HE CAME OVER HE'S LIKE I CAN'T TELL IF THAT'S HIS HEART OR MY HEART YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL FREAKING OUT
WE DO GET THOSE GLIMPSES THOUGH WHERE WE ARE OKAY JUST SITTING HAVING A COFFEE WITH A FRIEND OR
SO E WHEN YOU WERE IN PRISON
I LEFT THE CONVERSATION AND WALKED TO THE NEXT ROOM
YOU KNOW
FROM THE STRUGGLE IN A SENTENCE SURVEY FILLED OUT BY A GUY WHO CALLS HIMSELF WISHITWERESIMPLE
SO
BUT I ALSO HAD A FUCKED-UP RELATIONSHIP WITH MY THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD TEACHER AT FOURTEEN
MEDICATED ALL THROUGH THE EIGHTY S
YOU KNOW IT'S NO JOKE
WHEN WE GOT TO THE CHURCH I ASKED ONE OF THEM TO HOLD MY HAND WHILE WE WALKED IN
SO CHECK IT OUT DR JONICE WEBB
ALL THOSE THINGS STARTED TO GO AWAY AND THEY STARTED TO DISSIPATE FROM MY LIFE AND WERE YOU TELLING IT PRIMARILY TO YOUR THERAPIST
YOU KNOW MAKE SOME REAL
BUT THEN HE THREW HIS HELMET OFF LIKE HE WAS ABOUT TO DROP THE GLOVES
RAGE AT ANYONE WHO MIGHT FEEL JUSTIFIED IN JUDGING ME OR FORCING ME TO GIVE BIRTH TO A CHILD I DIDN'T WANT
HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS TO ME WHEN OTHER PEOPLE SAID ME TOO SO UM
SHE DID THIS FOR HER AMUSEMENT ONLY NOT ONLY DID SHE DO THIS TO ME SHE ALSO DID IT TO MY BROTHER
BECAUSE I
YOU KNOW
I SOAKED IT IN AND I SOAKED IT UP AND I LOVED IT I LOVED IT
AND I WAS LOOKING AT IT AND I
ACTUALLY THAT WOULD BE A VERY
OR IF HE DIED A SLOW LONG DEATH OBVIOUSLY IT'S BETTER FOR HIM
YOU GET A JOB
NO MATTER HOW HARMLESS MY CHOICE WAS TO BEGIN WITH
ABOUT HER ANGER
NIGHT I WENT TO BED AND I SAID YOU CAN WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND LEAVE BUT YOU HAVE TO SLEEP HERE YOU'LL MAKE A DECISION IN THE MORNING
SUPPORTING THIS SHOW AND I HOPE IF YOU'RE OUT THERE AND YOU'RE FEELING STUCK
AND SNAPSHOT FROM HIS LIFE
IT LIKE IT SMELLS BAD
DARE I EVEN SAY POETIC
A SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION THAT IS GRAVELY
JUST A BUNCH OF OLD GLASS BOTTLES
AND
HE LOOKED AT PICTURES OF CHILDREN ON THE INTERNET AND THE CHILDREN OFTEN DIDN'T HAVE ANY CLOTHES ON
THAT'S THE GIST OF IT THAT'S WHY I FEEL LIKE KILLING MYSELF SORRY IF THAT'S NOT A GOOD ENOUGH REASON FOR YOU
AN OTHER IN THE ONLY TOWN I'VE EVER CALLED HOME
I MENTIONED TO MY SISTER THAT SHE WOULD WANT TO GIVE ME A BATH AND SHE SAID I BET YOU LIKE THE WAY SHE GIVES YOU BATHS
AND AH
KIND OF RIDE WITH LIFE AND HAVE IT GET A LITTLE EASIER
WHY YOU IMMEDIATELY JUST SHUT DOWN
NEVER SAID A WORD
BUT ENJOY THE PHYSICAL ASPECT OF IT SO YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN THAT AND THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU WEIRD OR DIFFERENT AND I'M SENDING YOU A BIG HUG
BUT I STILL WASN'T SATISFIED
I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THE ASSIGNMENT WENT
THAT WAS ALL THAT WENT THROUGH MY HEAD
YOU KNOW
MY MOM DIED FIFTEEN MONTHS BEFORE THAT FROM BRAIN CANCER
AROUND THE SIDE OF JOHN'S HOUSE AND DOWN HIS NINE HUNDRED AND TEN FOOT DRIVEWAY
YOU KNOW
WE CHECK IN AND THEN WE WAIT FOR HIM TO COME THROUGH IT USUALLY TAKES FIFTEEN TWENTY MINUTES FOR HIM TO GET CLEARED AND COME THROUGH
IT'S CALLED MANAGEMENT
AND HE'S HAD TO SCROUNGE TOGETHER CASH TO COVER THEIR VET APPOINTMENT THIS MORNING
CONSTANTLY SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE TO FILL A VOID
YOU KNOW
JAWS TWO
WHEN MY STORY CAME OUT AND
SHARING AND HAVING
HE WALKED UP TO ME
SIXTY NINE ISH ANGLE
BECAUSE IT IS A PARTICULAR TRIP AND IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL AND IT'S WHY I ALWAYS GET ON MY SOAPBOX ABOUT THEM BECAUSE I WANT EVERYBODY TO EXPERIENCE THE GOOD ONES AT LEAST
I AGREE
I'M SURE THERE HAVE GOT TO BE SUPPORT GROUPS FOR
I EVENTUALLY MOVED OUT AND NOW I'M LIVING WITH MY SISTER
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
OH YEAH
AND I LEARNED HOW TO BECOME VULNERABLE
RUBBING HIS CONE UP AGAINST EVERYTHING
WE NEED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HIM
JUST A FEW CLOTHES AND WE WERE GONE I WOKE THAT NIGHT TO MY MOM SCREAMING AND THIS NEW GUY BEATING HER ASS
AS FRAGILE WHATEVER SHE NEEDS TO GET WHAT IT IS THAT SHE WANTS OUT OF YOU AT THAT MOMENT
IT CHANGED NOTHING NOTHING HAPPENED
AND THEN HERE'S YOUR NUMBER
DON'T DO IT
BUT SHE'S ALSO ADDICTED TO CODEINE MEDS

WHEN YOU GOT MARRIED TO DAD AND DIVORCED
I STARTED LAUGHING SO HARD THAT TEARS STARTED TO COME DOWN AND MY CAT GOT UP LOOKED AT ME IN HIS JUDGMENTAL CAT WAY
I DON'T KNOW IT JUST
INSTEAD
IT GETS EASIER
THAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL
MY GOD SOMEBODY DOES WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING
OKAY YEAH
IS
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER REALLY HAD THAT KIND OF
HAVE YOU SHARED THESE THINGS WITH OTHERS I HAVEN'T SHARED THE HISTORY OF MY CONNECTION TO VIOLENT MEDIA
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
I HAD TO LEARN TO LOVE MYSELF
DUDE
SO WHERE DO YOU LIVE SHE ASKS
USED MY SIBLINGS AND ME TO CONVEY NASTY MESSAGES TO EACH OTHER OH YES THAT IS DEFINITELY EMOTIONAL ABUSE THAT IS SERIOUS EMOTIONAL ABUSE
ALL OF THIS WILL PASS SOON
THAT IS THE GOAL
JOINING MY FRIENDS AND ONLY EXPLAINING THE BASICS TO THEM ABOUT MY PREDICAMENT
DOING GOOD THINGS FOR OURSELF
HE WAS GOING TO CALL THE BIBB COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT
THAT THIS IS A PATTERN THAT YOU'RE ADDICTED TO
EVER BEEN THE VICTIM OF SEXUAL ABUSE SOME STUFF HAPPENED BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT COUNTS
HOWEVER I AM NOT FROM SOME BACKWATER I AM BRITISH AND A LONDONER
AND
YOU KNOW
HE KEEPS GETTING UP FROM THE TABLE AND PACING SPEAKING TO ME SHARPLY SAYING I JUST WANT THEM TO GET IN A QUOTE PISSING MATCH WITH TYLER
WAS IN A ROOM WITH THE DOOR SHUT
MEDITATING AND ON MY BICYCLE MY THERAPIST WAS LIKE I WANT YOU TO RIDE FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES A DAY
I WASN'T GOING TO DO WHATEVER I WAS DOING THAT SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT WAS NEVER
LIKE WIND AND NO PEOPLE
DON'T TURN YOU OFF FROM
THE DYNAMICS THAT WE SEE GOING ON IN FRONT OF US MODELED BY OUR PARENTS THAT IS A SCRIPT THAT WE CONSCIOUSLY OR SUBCONSCIOUSLY LEARN
HE'S LAYING ON HIS BACK
WHAT IF ANYTHING DO YOU WISH FOR I WISH THAT I DIDN'T SPEND SO MUCH TIME WORRYING ABOUT AND TRYING TO PREDICT THE FUTURE
LOOKED RIGHT UP AT ME AND SAID UP
AND
YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE I WAS
IN HER TWENTY S RAISED IN A PRETTY DYSFUNCTIONAL ENVIRONMENT
HIT SAN QUENTIN HARD
NO BUT TO BE MORE GUY-ISH AND TO KIND OF DISAPPEAR I'M REALLY GOOD AT DISAPPEARING
IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS DESIGNED BY LIZA MINNELLI LIKE IT CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THE SPOTLIGHT
I HADN'T PURCHASED MAPLE SYRUP FOR MYSELF
WE YOU
INSTEAD OF SUCKING YOUR MOTHER AND I DRY
CAPITAL OF CANADA
AND
HE WRITES THEO FLEURY CHALLENGED ME TO A FIGHT IN THE PARKING LOT OF THE UNITED CENTER
YOU KNOW
YOU EVER BEEN PHYSICALLY OR EMOTIONALLY ABUSED FROM THE AGES OF TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN I LIVED WITH MY MATERNAL GRANDMOTHER
LOVE WHEN THE SURVEYS MAKE ME LAUGH
UM
CALLING YOU SHE
AND YOU KNOW THAT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE I WROTE PLAYING WITH FIRE IN
I WAS ABLE TO HAVE SOME COMPASSION FOR THAT PERSON I WAS RESENTFUL AT
NOW AT EIGHT AND ELEVEN
YOU KNOW NO COPING MECHANISM AT THE TIME FOR THE PERSON WHO CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY EVERY PERSON IN THAT SITUATION DOESN'T IMMEDIATELY GO TO A PARENT OR IMMEDIATELY GO TO THE POLICE WHAT DO YOU I UNDERSTAND WHY BUT
I WENT TO THE STORE SPECIFICALLY FOR THOSE ITEMS AND WAS WALKING AROUND SYRUP BOTTLE IN HAND AND HAD TO PAUSE IN ONE OF THE AISLES
AND
IT'S INCREDIBLE
YOU KNOW
HOW LONG ARE YOU IN TOWN
THE INTERNAL ME IS OVERWHELMED AND STRUGGLES TO MAINTAIN DESIRE TO CONNECT WITH MY HUSBAND OR CLOSE FRIENDS
THIS WAS FAR GREATER
I DON'T THINK I'VE DONE ANOTHER EPISODE THAT HAD AS MANY RESPONSES AND
BUT AS USUAL I APPROVE THIS STORY
LIKE DECOMPOSED FRUIT AND FEET
HAVING HIDDEN IT
WE GET TO HANG OUT WITH DIFFERENT CAST MEMBERS
ALLEN WROTE HIM
BUT THAT SHE COULD NOT FACE THE FACT
A TYPE OF EPISODE
UM
DO I KICK NASH OUT FOR SOMETHING I DIDN'T WITNESS
AS FAST AS YOU'D LIKE HER TO
WHAT IF ANYTHING WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO SOMEONE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
BUT YOU CAN'T TELL AN OLD ITALIAN LADY THAT YOU HAVE FUCKING HEART DISEASE IN THE FAMILY
I KNOW I SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD BUT
I DON'T KNOW THAT SOUNDS PRETTY HEALTHY
I FELT IT BECAUSE THAT IS
READING IT
I MEAN I WAS A TOMBOY GROWING UP SO I ALWAYS HAD GUY FRIENDS AND I ALWAYS
YOUR DAD BEATS THE SHIT OUT OF YOUR MOM WELL GUESS WHAT YOU'RE GONNA PROBABLY DO WHEN YOU GROW UP
THE LOVE AND THE SUPPORT AND
I AM NOT A THERAPIST I'M BARELY A HUMAN BEING
OR JUST SPREADING THE WORD THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA REDDIT FACEBOOK
HE ALWAYS USED TO CALL ME AND TALK ABOUT MADONNA OR SOME OTHER HOLLYWOOD GOSSIP KIND OF HIS WAY OF MOCKING PEOPLE WHO FOLLOWED IT BUT ALSO BECAUSE HE WAS A BIT INTO IT
ABOUT HER SEX ADDICTION FUCK THAT EMPTY FEELING OUT OF ME
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S KERSTEN OR KERSTEEN
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS PODCAST IS TO TALK ABOUT ISSUES THAT FALL INTO A GRAY AREA
SET BOUNDARIES WITH HER
RIGHT
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT CAN ABSOLUTELY RUIN A MARRIAGE IF IT ISN'T BROUGHT TO THE SURFACE AND DEALT WITH
ONTO THE ROAD BEHIND ME
YOU KNOW
AND THEN THAT SEPARATE WAS BAD BECAUSE I WAS VERY AWKWARD AND NOT ASKED TO DANCES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
I DON'T AND I
AND SO
I'M VERY ASHAMED OF THE FACT THAT IF THERE ARE ANY SWEETS AROUND I EAT ALL OF THEM JUST TO GET RID OF THAT TEMPTATION LATER

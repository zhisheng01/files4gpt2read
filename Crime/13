LET'S GET TO THE SURVEYS
I GAVE THEM MY FIANCE'S PHONE NUMBER ONLY NOT MY FAMILY'S
IS BEING RAISED IN A PRETTY DYSFUNCTIONAL ENVIRONMENT NEVER BEEN SEXUALLY ABUSED BUT HE HAS BEEN PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY ABUSED
LOST SO MUCH TIME AND
IT OWNS ME THE FIRST SECOND IT
AND SPEAKING OF BITCH
SOMEWHERE THAT IF ANYBODY COULD FIND IT IT WOULD BE ME
I THINK I FORGET
SO YOU KNOW WE'LL SAY YOU'RE THIS TRAVELING MAN FROM AH
I THOUGHT I HATED PURPLE NO MY MOTHER HATED PURPLE I THOUGHT I HATED WEARING DRESSES NO MY MOTHER HATED PUTTING ME IN DRESSES
SO HOW DO YOU KEEP GOING
OFTENTIMES WHEN WE WOULD GET INTO AN ARGUMENT SHE WOULD TRY TO TAUNT ME TO HIT HER
YOUR COUSIN DRINKS CYANIDE AND THEN A REPORTER SHOWS UP AT COURT AFTERWARDS SAYING HE'D BEEN INVESTIGATING POTENTIAL CRIMES AND CORRUPTION AND WRONGDOING WITH HIM FOR MORE THAN A YEAR
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THE PODCAST TO BE
BUT I WAS SURE THAT IF I COULD JUST MEET SOMEONE GET MARRIED
THE IMPORTANCE OF
KIND OF OUR EMOTIONAL SKELETON
YOU'RE HAVING A HEART ATTACK RIGHT NOW
BUT THEN FAYE TOLD HIM WHEN JOHN HAD ACTUALLY DIED
TAPING DURING THE DAY THAT I NOW TAPE ON OFF HOURS AND I GUESS I'M FINDING OUT THAT THEY DON'T RUN THE AIR CONDITIONING AT NIGHT AND ON THE WEEKENDS HERE
AND I WAS GOING THROUGH
SO MUCH AH RECOVERY
UM
SO YOU KNOW WHAT DOES TRAUMA IN FORMED EDUCATION LOOK LIKE
CLOSED
THANK YOU FOR THAT KATIE
SHE GAVE ME A SMALL VERY PLATONIC KISS ON THE CHEEK AND LOOKED ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYES
ASIDE FROM THAT I'M PRETTY VANILLA
SNAPSHOT FROM HER LIFE DRIVING FOR TWO MILES NOT REALIZING I NEVER MOVED MY HIGH HEELS FROM THE HOOD OF MY CAR TO THE INSIDE OF MY CAR
IS NOT EASILY FORGIVEN UNTIL WE TAKE THIS AND SAY LOOK
WE CAN
I HAVE FANTASIES ABOUT SOME DAY RECREATING THAT SITUATION I WISH I COULD AFFORD TO PAY SOMEONE
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
AND FUCKING RUSSIA'S POPPING IT'S HEAD UP
ANYWAY
I'D LIKE TO INTERVIEW SOME MORE COLLEGE-AGED PEOPLE
WE GIVE PEOPLE WHO NORMALLY HAVE BEEN IGNORED AN OPPORTUNITY TO TELL THEIR STORIES AND IT'S A DIFFICULT SUBJECT
THIS IS FROM
CURE YOUR GAYNESS
AND HE SAID FINISH WATCHING THIS WITH ME
I THINK THEY KNEW THAT THESE PEOPLE
ABUSE OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT
TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH UNRESOLVED PROBLEMS
BOY YOUR MOM REALLY REALLY DOES NOT SEE HEAR OR FEEL YOU
I DON'T KNOW
WHEN MY PARENTS SEPARATED I LIVED WITH MY DAD OUT OF CONVENIENCE IT WAS MY MOM WHO LEFT AND SO
I DIDN'T FEEL MUCH ONLY A SENSE OF RELIEF THAT I MIGHT ACTUALLY GET HELP TO STOP HAVING THESE FEELINGS
HE SAYS FAYE DID TELL HIM JOHN HAD DIED
AND THAT'S LIKE
WE'LL MEET HALFWAY PORTLAND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO DO IT
THE SCARS ARE DEEP
YOUNG KID
UM SO I DRIVE OVER AND
ESPECIALLY THE LAST TEN YEARS OF MY LIFE TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS
I THINK ABOUT KILLING MYSELF A LOT OR JUST RUNNING AWAY AND CUTTING TIES WITH MY FAMILY
AND THAT IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER IN TERMS OF EMOTIONAL GROWTH
PULLED DOWN MY STOCKINGS AND REACHED UP IN BETWEEN MY THIGHS AND TOUCHED ME SHE LAUGHED AND TOLD ME THAT EVERY GIRL HAS A TICKLE BUTTON AND CONTINUED TO TOUCH ME THERE TO SEE IF I WOULD GIGGLE TOO
SOMEWHAT TRAUMATIC HAPPEN TO THEM
FAST-FORWARD
I DO NOT
I'VE FALLEN A BIT BEHIND IN THE PODCAST AND I'M ATTEMPTING TO CATCH BACK UP I'VE BEEN REALLY BUSY ATTEMPTING TO BETTER MYSELF LATELY
SOMETIMES IT'S MORE PAINFUL TO THINK OF HOW MUCH BETTER THINGS COULD GET
CONSIDERING BEING RUN OVER BY A BUS BECAUSE I TALKED TO SOMEONE AND THEY DIDN'T REPLY
AND AH
I DON'T
SITTING ON THE COUCH WITH THEM
UM
A LOT OF TIME WHEN I WAS OUT OF CONTROL I WASN'T WITH PEOPLE THAT I LOVED I WASN'T WITH PEOPLE THAT I DISRESPECTED
THOSE MORALS WERE STILL THERE AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT HELPED ME COME OUT OF IT WAS
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT
AND THAT ALLOWS HER TO LIKE TO LEARN SOMETHING AND TO GROW
HOW WOULD YOU VIEW THAT
EITHER I LIVE THE REST OF MY LIFE AS A LONELY MAN WHO WISHES HE WERE A WOMAN OR I LIVE MY LIFE AS A LONELIER WOMAN WHO HATES HERSELF
LIKE THAT MAYBE EVERY EIGHT SECONDS IT WAS I WAS TRYING TO COUNT AND DO ALL MY THINGS AT THE SAME TIME AND
LIKE
RIGHT BEING ABLE TO PICK PICK A GOD OF MY OWN UNDERSTANDING I WAS LIKE WOW
BUT I JUST I FEEL THE MOST CONNECTED KIND OF TO THE UNIVERSE AND THE MOST AT PEACE JUST STANDING ON A HILL
I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHAT HOLDING THAT SHAME IN FEELS LIKE IT FEELS SAFE BUT SLOWLY MAN IT JUST DRAGS US DOWN
WHAT KEEPS YOUR HOPES UP
SHE IS TWENTY TWO
I HATE HEARING THAT RIGHT I REMEMBER THAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO BACK IN
MY SISTER IS AN ABSOLUTE BLESSING IN MY LIFE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO WITHOUT HER
THANK YOU CRAFTY
I WISH I HAD A LIST OF DIFFERENT EMOTIONS
PROFESSIONAL MENTAL COUNSELLING
YES HIDE IN YOUR ROOM
THAT'S INTERESTING THAT
SEXUAL FANTASIES MOST POWERFUL TO YOU I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY SEXUAL FANTASIES MORE SEXUAL FEARS
YOU KNOW
I REALLY HOPE YOU SHARE WITH SOMEBODY AND I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT START WITH SHARING THAT WITH YOUR FAMILY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT SOUND CAPABLE OF OWNING THEIR PART IN THIS THING
YOU GOT UNTRUSTING
FINALLY
THEY DIDN'T BECOME KILLERS
IF YOU'RE GOING TO YELL THAT AT YOUR KID THAT'S THE BEST PLACE TO DO IT THOUGH BECAUSE IT JUST BLENDS IN
AS YOU'RE SHARING THAT I'M THINKING WHY IS STILLNESS SO SCARY FOR SOME OF US
OUTSIDE OF MY RELATIONSHIP
TALK ABOUT WHAT IT FELT LIKE
WOULD NOT BE FEELING INCREDIBLY SAD AND YOU WOULD NOT BE QUESTIONING WHY YOU EXIST
BUT HE DISAPPEARED ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS REALLY COUNTS AS EMOTIONAL ABUSE

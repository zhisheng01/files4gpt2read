JOHN EMAILED IT SAYING IT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HE'D EVER SEND ME
WAS MY SON
ANY KIND OF COMB
YOU KNOW
I WAS VERY CLOSE TO MY PARENTS ESPECIALLY MY DADDY
IT'S JUST INTERESTING HOW
I DO A LOT OF WORK TO HIDE MY TRUE SELF FROM OTHERS AND TRY VERY HARD TO ALWAYS BE JOKING AND SMILING EVEN WHEN ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS SLITTING MY WRISTS
THEN YOU CAN JUST FISH BURRITOS
HE'S BEEN MY BEST FRIEND FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS AND ALTHOUGH I DO HAVE OTHER FRIENDS IT IS HARD FOR ME TO SHARE THESE FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH OTHER PEOPLE BASICALLY
YUP NOPE NOT GOING BACK
BUT I'M EQUALLY TERRIFIED OF WAITING FOR DEATH TO FIND ME
I WAS LIKE FUCK
I MEAN
LET'S WRAP THIS THING UP
I'M INVISIBLE
I DON'T KNOW AND
WITH SORT OF THE WRECKAGE OF MY PAST AND
AND BROUGHT IT UP AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY I FLATLY REFUSED TO LET THEM FORGET IT
SHE TEXTED ME TO TELL ME THAT SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT MOMENT
I AM SO GRATEFUL
YOU CAN FIND VOICES OF SAN QUENTIN ON INSTAGRAM
HE WAS CLEARLY DIFFERENT TOM SAYS JOHN DIDN'T MAKE ANY FRIENDS AT BIRMINGHAM SOUTHERN AND HE DIDN'T LIVE THERE
MY BROTHER
SNAPSHOT FROM HER LIFE
SHE IS BISEXUAL IN HER TWENTY S RAISED IN A TOTALLY CHAOTIC ENVIRONMENT NEVER BEEN SEXUALLY ABUSED
THAT'S THE DAMAGE THEY DO
FROM DISPATCHER TO OFFICER TO DETECTIVE
I THINK I WAS SO TIRED YESTERDAY I WENT TO GO GET SOMETHING TO EAT
I THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE
LET'S DO IT A THIRD TIME
STILL THOUGH HE'S PAYING TWO TO FOUR SOUPS PER CALL TWO TO FOUR SOUPS PER CALL IT'S A BARTER SYSTEM NYGE YOU GIVE ME YOUR SOUPS I GIVE YOU MY PLACE IN THE PHONE LINE WELL
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU INSIDE
YOU HAVE MANY PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE WHO LOVE YOU SO SO MUCH
YOU KNOW I WAS LIVING IN SANTA FE NEW MEXICO
WHERE WE LIVED TO DC IS ALMOST AN HOUR ONE WAY THIS DUDE DROVE BACK AND FORTH DOUBLE SHIFTS
HOW DO YOU KEEP YOUR CLOTHES LOOKING SHARP HOW DO YOU KEEP YOUR SKIN CLEAR HOW DO YOU GET A GOOD HAIRCUT
I'M REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD YOUR YOUR DAUGHTER IS
YOU KNOW THE COLGATE
GOD BLESS HIM WOULD NEVER I ALWAYS WANTED HIM JUST TO COME TO MY ROOM AND SORT OF ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT WAS GOING ON HEY ARE YOU OKAY DID YOU HEAR THAT AND IT'S LIKE AS SOON AS SHE LEFT HE WAS SORT OF EMBARRASSED OR I DON'T KNOW AND JUST
AND SHE ALSO MENTIONS THAT
I STOPPED AND I TURNED AROUND AND I LOOKED AT HIM
FUCKIN' CELEBRATE IT YOU KNOW
HE CALLS ME WHILE HE'S DOING IT
SAME SURVEY FILLED OUT BY TIM
UM
SO IT WASN'T THAT COMPLICATED
AND I HAVE NO INTEREST IN TELLING THEM
AFTER SHE WAS DONE ABUSING ME THAT IT WAS ALL A DREAM OR MADE UP IN MY HEAD I WAS AROUND EIGHT OR NINE
AND OF COURSE WITH BOXING THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT I CAN DO UNLESS I FOUND SOME PEOPLE WHO WERE WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO HELP WHICH I EVENTUALLY DID
YOU DID NOT ENTICE HIM
AND I THINK
OPEN VULNERABLE
DO NOT
THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THINGS
HOPE IS HARDER TO COME BY
WOULD YOU GAMBLE ALL YOUR MONEY AWAY AND THEN THINK IT WAS RIGHT TO GUILT YOUR DAUGHTER
I DON'T REALLY HAVE MANY HOBBIES AND ALTHOUGH I HAVE MANY GOOD FRIENDS I RARELY HANG OUT WITH THEM AND STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN MY OWN SOCIAL LIFE
MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS LATER AND I STILL BLAME MYSELF FOR HIS DEATH AND THE COPS NOT DOING ANYTHING
HE GOES ON QUOTE
I I IT I IT TOOK SOMETHING OUT OF ME
THANK YOU FOR THAT
BUT I WAS FEELING LESS AGITATED
HOW
YOU KNOW THERE WAS SOMETHING MISSING IN MY LIFE AND
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US INDIVIDUALLY HAS A STORY
HERE HE IS HE'S HANGING OUT
NATURE WILL ALWAYS BE MY SANCTUARY AND THE MUDDY TRAILS ARE MY PLAYGROUND THIS WINTER
HEAT RETURNED TO MY BONES AND I CRAWLED BACK TO MY BED TO SLEEP WAKING UP HOURS LATER WITH A SPLITTING HEADACHE A BRUISED EYE
DEEPEST DARKEST THOUGHTS KINKY SEX DEEPEST DARKEST SECRETS KINKY SEX
IN HER TWENTIES ABOUT HER ANXIETY SHE SAYS THAT FEELING THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE ROOM AND YOU CANNOT GET OUT FAST ENOUGH
AND I WAS HOOKED
I MEAN
UM
TYSON ENTERED THE ICE AT THE ZAMBONI ENTRANCE AND SKATED AROUND A BIT
AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU OPEN UP TO SOMEBODY
RIGHT
THIS WOULD HAVE TO DO
LIKE
I DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN IT
YEAH SO I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT IF I WERE TO CROSS THAT THRESHOLD THAT DAY
HE SAID KERRY ARE YOU KIDDING ME
I GET TO WEIGH IN ON THIS VERY VERY
EVER BEEN THE VICTIM OF SEXUAL ABUSE YES AND I NEVER REPORTED IT MY FIRST SEXUAL EXPERIENCE WAS AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN AND I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS ASSAULT UNTIL MY EARLY TWENTY S IT REALLY PAVED THE WAY FOR MY FUTURE SEXUAL EXPERIENCES
I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT MOMENT OF COMPASSION
ALWAYS AGREEING WITH WHATEVER THEY SAID AND DID AND NEVER VOICING ANY CONCERNS NEEDS OR WANTS OF MY OWN
I COULD FEEL THE EMOTIONS BUBBLING UP INSIDE ME
AND
HE'S ABOUT TO DO THAT HE'LL SAY
I DIDN'T DESERVE TO LIVE AND THAT'S WHAT MY MIND TOLD ME
SO
THAT FEELING YOU GET WHEN YOU WATCH SOMEONE STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS WASH A DISH IN THE KITCHEN SINK AND YOU THINK TO YOURSELF WHERE THE HELL DO THEY GET THE ENERGY OR MOTIVATION TO DO THAT
VERY PLAYFUL
WHICH USED TO ANNOY THE SHIT OUT OF ME
FILLED OUT BY A WOMAN WHO CALLS HERSELF I KNEW I WAS CRAZY
SO I DON'T CARE TO RECEIVE ANY INCOMING CALLS AT MIDNIGHT KNOWING I HAVE TO GET UP EARLY TO GO TO WORK
AS CLIMATE CHANGE RENDERS THE PLACES THAT WE LIVE MORE DIFFICULT TO INHABIT
HOW MUCH WE CAN HEAL
READ THAT BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO
KERRY YOU GOTTA DO SOMETHING HE SAID
I THINK ABOUT HALF OF THE WORK I DO LIKE THE WORK

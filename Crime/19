LIKE I LOVE YOU FOR THESE TEN REASONS YOU FEED ME FOR THE IN THESE TEN WAYS REALLY PRACTICAL
YOU KNOW
AND AH
THAT'S
IN THE CITY NEWSPAPER
KARATE KID ONE AND THREE
IT IS SO HARD TO UNLEARN WANTING TO SAVE OTHER PEOPLE OR WANTING TO CHANGE THE MOOD OF A ROOM
THIS IS A STRUGGLE IN A SENTENCE FILLED OUT BY
HAVE A MEDIUM TO GET OUT AND SO ON BEHALF OF THE MEN HERE AT SAN QUENTIN ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ARNULFO GARCIA
WITH MYSELF AND
SO I REALLY WANT THAT KIND OF VALIDATION
RIGHT
THE RAIN SOAKING INTO MY SHOES AND HAIR DIDN'T MATTER
YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE ABOUT YOU GUYS
IT'S MANAGED
AND THAT'S WHEN I KNEW MY DAD REALLY WAS BACK SEE
NOT ONLY HIM BUT HIS MOTHER AND HER SISTERS MY GREAT-AUNTS WERE A HUGE UM
SO WHAT DOES IT DO
THIS IS A HAPPY MOMENT FROM SULLEN ARTIST AND SHE WRITES I'VE BEEN SEWING FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS AND I MADE A BEAUTIFUL GATHERED RECTANGLE SKIRT FOR MYSELF WITH THE FABRIC LEFTOVER I MADE A MATCHING ONE FOR MY TWO YEAR OLD NIECE I TRIED IT ON HER AND SHE REFUSED TO TAKE IT OFF THE REST OF THE DAY BECAUSE SHE LOVED IT SO MUCH
YOU KNOW I PUT ON THE EQUIPMENT AND I DIDN'T FALL DOWN AND I DIDN'T STRUGGLE AND UM
WHAT'S THE AH THE CRABBING STORY
IT'S JUST YOU NEED A DIFFERENT TOOL TO EXPRESS YOUR LOVE AND SUPPORT OF HER
WAS THERE DISHONESTY SOMEWHERE
IT'S VERY EASY
AND
THAT'S A GOOD ONE
THIS IS FILLED OUT BY A WOMAN WHO CALLS HERSELF VIXEN
THAT IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT
ETERNAL LOVE HAPPINESS AND SUCCESS FOR MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY
EVERY THANK GOD NOT SEXUALLY ABUSIVE EVERY ABUSIVE BUT
AS WELL AS THE TWO OTHERS THEY'RE HERE WITH AND JOHN'S LAWYER BOOZER DOWNS INTO HIS CHAMBERS TO HAVE A PRIVATE MEETING
THERE'S NOTHING SHE AND I ENJOY MORE THAN A SKETCHY ENCOUNTER WITH SOMEBODY GRAPPLING WITH THE LANGUAGE
IT'S NICE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE AT THE PHARMACY
BEAR WITH US
GET TO KNOW WHAT IS POSSIBLE
PROCESS THAT CHILDHOOD STUFF BECAUSE IT IS RELATED TO THAT FEELING I MEAN YOUR MOM TRAINED YOU TO PUT HER NEEDS BEFORE YOURS
MY HEART STARTED PUMPING
AND NOW I VIEW HIS BLOG EVERY DAY UNDER A WEB PROXY
I MEAN
I SURVIVED
YOU KNOW ONCE YOU SEE THEM LAY IT OUT ON A CHART ON IN A SHOT YOU'RE LIKE OH
IF THAT'S YOUR DARKEST SECRET
I AM TO BLAME
HANGS HIS PHONE ON HIS BELT SO I CAN HEAR
TO SAY THIS PICTURE PERFECT FAMILY WAS REVOLTED IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT
I HAVEN'T WORKED FOR ANYBODY SINCE
I HEARD ABOUT HIM AND GOT HIM TO COME DOWN INTO THE MEDIA LAB TO EXPLAIN HOW HE STARTED MAKING HIS SOAP BACK WHEN HE WAS IN L A COUNTY BEFORE HE GOT TO SAN QUENTIN
I CAN'T PUT INTO WORDS WHAT THAT SIMPLE THING MEANS TO ME
BUT NOT REALLY
COULD BE WRONG
STICK YOUR ELBOWS OUT AND DO THE DELAWARE HEN
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT THEY DIDN'T FREEZE IN THAT IN THAT MOMENT
AND SO IT'S
I'LL LOOK YOU RIGHT IN THE EYE AND SAY I DON'T WANT TO TOUCH YOUR POOP BECAUSE I'M GOING TO EAT
WE WERE SITTIN' IN THE LIVING ROOM DOWNSTAIRS
SOUNDS TOTALLY NORMAL AND HEALTHY
IN SOCIETY THEY SAY I NEED TO BE SHOT AND HUNG
MY FAMILY TO THIS DAY STILL SAYS IT WAS THE BEST TIME AT DISNEY EVEN THOUGH I BARELY REMEMBER ANY OF IT
THINGS ON THE OUTSIDE WITH THE LAW WITH OUR FAMILIES THEY HAPPEN BEYOND OUR CONTROL
A WISE MAN DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF PAPER MONEY IN A WOOD FRAME HOUSE
HE DID NOT DISCLOSE THOSE DETAILS TO ME THERE'S THINGS I WON'T DISCUSS WITH THAT THING TURNED ON NOW BUT I'M UNBANKED
HOLY SHIT IT WASN'T ABOUT HIM
YOU FEEL GOOD MAKIN' THEM LOOK GOOD
THAT YOU WERE BRAINWASHED INTO PROTECTING AND CARING FOR
THEN WHY SHOULD YOU BE ANY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT
AND THE TRUTH IS
AND THEY'RE PROBABLY GONNA SAY YEAH
I'M TERRY THORNTON
CUT MYSELF TWICE AND BROKE MY MOM'S BLENDER WHEN IT FELL OFF A CUPBOARD I STRUCK WITH MY HEAD MANY TIMES
OR YOU KNOW MAYBE A GIRL ON THE BLOCK WHO WAS OLDER THAN ME THAT I HAD A CRUSH ON
HE USED THAT WORD ALL
WOW
AND I WAS LIKE WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT RIGHT
GIVING IT A GOOD RATING
JUDGING OTHER PEOPLE FOR NOT HAVING THEIR MEDS FILLED ON TIME OR GOING TO THE PHARMACY AND GETTING YOUR PRESCRIPTION PARTIALLY FILLED AND HAVING TO COME BACK AND WAIT IN THAT LONG LINE AGAIN
BUT
COMPLETELY WRONG WHAT THAT GUY WAS DOING AND JUST BECAUSE HE DIDN'T TOUCH YOUR GENITALS DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT WASN'T ABUSIVE THAT WAS
AND MY DESK
OK WELL HOW BOUT IF I JUST OPEN A BOTTLE OF WINE
I FOUND THIS SO HARD TO BELIEVE THAT I ACTUALLY ASKED CURTIS AND I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE FOR ANY STORY
AND IT JUST BREAKS MY HEART
BUT NO I WAS
MADE ME TOAST
THE STATE ISSUED SOAP THEY'RE LITTLE ITTY BITTY BARS LIKE MOTEL SOAP
HOLDING THEIR HAND OR
GRATEFULLY
THAT'S NOT A RELATIONSHIP THAT'S STATUTORY RAPE
I WOULD WRITE HER LETTERS IN THERE WAS IT WAIT IN YOUR MIND WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A JOURNAL AND A DIARY
OK
IT'S JUST THE JOB BUT YOU KNOW WHAT AT THE END OF THE DAY NO MATTER WHAT JOB YOU'RE DOING
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS A FRIEND SAID A FRIEND I LOST AND THEN SHE CAME BACK TO ME BECAUSE SHE WENT OUT AND EDUCATED HERSELF
AND THEN HE SAYS ALL RIGHT SHOOT IT THEN
AND
I THINK WHEN I STARTED TO GET OVER THE SHAKING AND CRYING IN THE RING AND I STARTED TO BE PRESENT
THAT I KNOW OF A AND PARTICIPATE IN A GROUP THAT WE STARTED
YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST
IS IT WAS IN THE SUPPORT GROUPS OF FEELING UM
CAN EXPERIENCE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT
AND HE PROCEEDS TO CHASE ALL OF YOU ALL PLAYING FOOTBALL WHAT DO YOU DO

YOU KNOW
UM BUT I JUST I FOUND THAT
AND THAT'S WRONG AND THAT MAKES THE CHILDREN FEEL REALLY BAD
HE WAS SO CAVALIER ABOUT IT
SHE TRIED MAKING ME LAUGH BUT SINCE IT DIDN'T SEEM TO WORK
AND
TAUGHT ME TO LISTEN TO MY NEEDS TO EVEN KNOW I HAD NEEDS
AND AFTER A CERTAIN MAYBE SIX PM YOU GOT AN HBO AND A COUPLE OF OTHER CHANNELS IT WAS A BOX NO BIGGER THAN THIS HERE YOU PRESS A LITTLE BUTTON ON IT
AND THEY'RE MOVING TO ALASKA
YOU TRY TO RIDE IT LIKE A FERRIS WHEEL
HOW DO GUYS DO IT
AND I THINK HE WANTED TO MAKE ME QUIT AND I JUST DIDN'T FOR YOUR OWN GOOD OR BECAUSE HE JUST WAS
GRATITUDE TO THE WOMEN WHO WORK AT THE ABORTION CLINIC FOR THEIR KINDNESS AND BRAVERY
HOW DO YOU CHANGE THAT ATTRACTION HOW DO YOU
EPISODES
LIKE WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING NOT ONLY OURSELVES THIS KID TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY WE'RE SIXTEEN WHAT THE FUCK DO WE KNOW WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING YOU KNOW AND
YOU KNOW MY ADDICTIONS TOOK ME OUT OF THE GAME TOOK ME OUT OF THE SPORT THAT I ABSOLUTELY LOVED AND AH
ALWAYS APOLOGIZING FOR EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE
SENDING YOU SOME LOVE XANNIE
PUTTING WORK INTO THERAPY IS THE ONLY WAY TO SEE RESULTS DON'T SETTLE FOR A THERAPIST YOU DON'T LIKE
YOU KNOW ABANDON ME
THAT'S TALENT I GOT TO TELL YOU THAT IS TALENT
THIS IS
I'M GOING TO READ HER SEXUAL FANTASIES BECAUSE I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW NORMALLY I
MY UNCLE WOULD ALWAYS HAVE TO CALL ME BACK ONCE MY BREAK WAS OVER YELLING COME ON KID DUTY CALLS AND I'D RUN BACK LOVING HOW GOOD IT FELT TO BE NEEDED
I MEAN IT WAS LIKE ROMEO AND JULIET IT WAS LIKE
TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO MY FIANCE THAT BY
WHICH
I'M CONFUSED I THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S MARRIED AND HE'S HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH THIS WOMAN
WAS
JUST REMEMBER
HE WAS SO UPSET
EVEN THOUGH PHYSICALLY I WAS EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YEARS OLD
AND THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING INSTEAD OF ISOLATING AND TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF INTELLECTUALLY
SEXUAL FANTASIES MOST POWERFUL TO YOU SUCKING DICK OR ORAL SEX IN GENERAL
WHEN I FINALLY GAVE WEIGHT TO ALL OF THESE THINGS
I WANT THEM TO KNOW BECAUSE I DO LOVE THEM AND MY LIFE IS SO MUCH FULLER WITH THEM IN IT
WE HAVE TO DO THIS AGAIN
I KNOW
HE WAS RELUCTANT TO COME OVER
IT'S USUALLY WHEN I'M JUST OUT OF ENERGY AND SELF-CONTROL WHEN HE'S BEING ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT AND I FEEL ANXIETY ABOUT OUR FUTURE
IT'S THE FEELINGS UNDERNEATH IT THAT MAKE US WANT TO DRINK OR GET HIGH OR SHOPLIFT OR WHATEVER
YOU NAME IT
I CAN'T HATE YOU
A DIARY WOULD SAY
I'VE ALSO BEEN USED MANY TIMES BY FRIENDS THROUGHOUT MY LIFE TO MAKE ME LOOK AWFUL AND THEREFORE
AND
SLAMMING THE DOOR BEHIND HER I COULDN'T BE ALONE
HE'S NOT SURE IF HE'S GONNA BE ABLE TO
SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN IRON
AND THAT PUTTING ON A SHOW
SOME MEN DO
AND ON AN AVERAGE DAY NOW WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
RUN
THERE'S NO WAY OUT
HOW ABOUT THAT
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO HIDE THE CRIME FROM THE OTHER GUYS INSIDE
I PICKED UP THE PHONE AND JUST BAWLED INTO IT
I LIKED THOSE HEELS TOO
AND I'D NEVER REALIZED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT THAT
AND THEN THERE WAS THIS
AND I WANTED TO TAKE HIS PAIN AWAY
AND WHEN IN FACT IT WAS EXCEL IN LIGHT OF INSTEAD OF UM
ONE DAY AT WORK SURROUNDED BY MY COWORKERS AND FRIENDS I FELT THE DARKNESS CREEPING IN
WRACKING YOUR BRAIN TRYING TO THINK WHAT DID I DO TO MAKE THEM HATE ME
YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT WE'RE REALLY GOOD AT IS WE'RE GOOD AT COLLECTING ENABLERS
I'M AS BROKE AS I WAS WHEN I LEFT THE NAVY
HONEST CONVERSATIONS
BEING A PART OF THIS COMMUNITY AND I HOPE IF YOU'VE LISTENED THIS FAR IN THIS EPISODE THAT YOU
I WAS ABLE TO LET SOME OF IT OUT
BUT HE JUST WALKED UP TO ME AND HUGGED ME
AND THAT WAS GROUNDS TO KICK ME OUT OF HER HOME WE JUST LIVED IN A SMALL TWO-BEDROOM APARTMENT IN TORZANA
LET'S READ AN AWFULSOME MOMENT
IN CHICAGO
IN THE ROYCE WHITE EPISODE THAT WAS A LIVE EPISODE WE DID THERE WAS
YEAH EXACTLY SO MY MOTHER HAD CUSTODY OF ME
YEP
A PLACE FOR HONESTY ABOUT ALL THE BATTLES IN OUR HEADS FROM MEDICALLY DIAGNOSED CONDITIONS PAST TRAUMAS AND SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION TO EVERYDAY COMPULSIVE NEGATIVE THINKING THIS SHOW IS NOT MEANT TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MENTAL COUNSELING
LIKE THE NUMBER OF BOOKS I'VE READ I COULD PROBABLY COUNT ON ONE HAND AND MAY NOT EVEN REMEMBER IF I'VE READ THEM AND DON'T REMEMBER WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT
YOU KNOW WITH THE TRAUMA AND THE ABUSE AND ALL THAT
FAYE IS PURPOSELY VAGUE
AND HEEDED MY WISHES
AND AFTER SOME INSCRUTABLE RESPONSES TO MY QUESTIONS DID YOU CALL EVERYONE ON THE LIST

AND RIGHT AWAY WE RUN IN AND
I'M NOW BACK IN A RURAL AREA LIVING WITH HER

THE FOOD MEMORY IS THAT MY MOM WOULD EAT LIKE A BIG BOWL OF LETTUCE ONLY AND MY DAD WOULD HAVE
CORRESPOND WITH YOUR COUNSELOR
WHICH DOESN'T GET FILLED OUT TOO OFTEN BUT I FIND ENDLESSLY FASCINATING AND I WANTED TO READ THIS ONE BECAUSE
I WANT SOMEONE TO TELL ME THEY'RE PROUD OF ME EVEN IF JUST FOR THAT THAT I MANAGED TO GET THAT FAR AND THEY HAVE FAITH THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE IT EVEN FARTHER MY ISSUES AREN'T EVEN THAT BAD COMPARED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE'S
WAS
MAKING IT OK FOR ME THAT WAS MORE FOR ME THAN IT WAS FOR HER
I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S THIS LEFT DAD

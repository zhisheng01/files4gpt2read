THINK MY VOICE IS STARTING TO GET TIRED
THOSE IMAGES
I EMPTY OUT MY WHOLE DESK CHECK THE FLOOR AND MY BOOKBAG AND I CANNOT FIND IT
I LEARNED ABOUT LATHES AND DIVIDING ENGINES AND DOUBLE HELICAL GEARS AND TOLERANCES AND SIDEREAL TIME
GIVE ME A FEELING OF MEANING AND PURPOSE
MUSKRAT OR WHATEVER YOU FUCKING WEIRDOES PET
OPENED IT UP AND I STABBED HIM I STABBED THE GUY TEN TIMES
A BEAUTIFUL STYLISH WATCH THAT DIDN'T COST A TON OF MONEY
AND I WAS SO CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT IT WOULD FEEL LIKE WHEN
AND FINDING SOMEONE THAT DID SOME OR ONE OF THOSE SPORTS WITH ME
YOU KNOW I CAN BRING AWARENESS
DID YOU I DROVE HIM DOWN
AND NOTHING'S ACTUALLY WRONG AND I'M JUST BEING A BIG BABY
ALL THE TIME AND IN NEW ENGLAND
COBRA WAS HER BOYFRIEND I
IT WAS
DID YOU FEEL THEN WHEN YOU HAD THAT
THOUGH FOR A FEW OF THE BIG TICKET ONES HE DOES
THE ARRIVAL WHERE THREE FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE REMEMBER THEIR FIRST MOMENTS IN PRISON
GO TALK TO SOMEBODY
MEN WEREN'T ALLOWED TO CRY MEN WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO CRY BUT
WHEN WE'RE KIDS
AND
A MARRIED COUPLE AFTER ABOUT A YEAR OF COMMUNICATING WITH THIS COUPLE
NOT ONE OF THEM SHOWED UP AT JOHN'S FUNERAL
I THINK I WOULD BE REMISS
IT'S HARD TO NOT FEEL SHAME BECAUSE I WONDER HOW MANY WERE AFRAID
AND UM
I JUST STARTED TO FEEL AS IF UM I WAS JUST COMING IN COMPLAINING ABOUT THINGS
AND THE VIBE HERE IS DIFFERENT THAN BIBB COUNTY
BUT WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO GO THERE
TOLD MY MOM HER PREGNANT SISTER COULD STILL WEAR THE SMALLER SIZE
I WAS UNABLE TO BREATHE FOR ABOUT TWENTY SECONDS AND I BEGAN SWEATING PROFUSELY
AND
WHAT IF ANYTHING WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO SOMEONE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO I WOULD TELL MY MOM TO KEEP TRYING TO COMFORT ME WHEN I CRY
THIS IS WHAT WAS CREATED THAT DAY
MANY TIMES ANGER SAVED MY LIFE
HERE I AM ON MY TWENTY THIRD YEAR AND I HAVEN'T SEEN MY DAUGHTER YET
ANY POSITIVE EXPERIENCES WITH THE ABUSERS I STILL LOVE MY MOM AND HER REFUSAL TO TALK ABOUT WHAT SHE DID MAKES ME FEEL THAT I'M BEING TOO HARD ON HER OR EXAGGERATING
TURN INTO A SHELL AND NOT PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS GOING ON AROUND ME
AND THEN THIS SWEET LITTLE GIRL'S GONE
SUPPORT THE SHOW READ BLOGS
I'M IN FIFTH GRADE I'M ABOUT TO PUT A MATH ASSIGNMENT AWAY IN THE FOLDER I KEEP IN THE BASKET UNDER MY CHAIR THE NEXT THING I KNOW MY TEACHER AND THE MATH SPECIALIST APPROACH ME AND ASK TO SEE THE ASSIGNMENT
TO EXPERIENCE ANYTHING OTHER THAN GRAY
EASY
I'M NOT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT I AM REALLY AFRAID OF I AM AFRAID OF LOOKING NEEDY
AMY HAS A LOVED ONE IN A FEDERAL PRISON IN MISSISSIPPI
THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT
WHAT DO YOU DO YOU KNOW
AND THEN WHEN THEY RELEASED HIM MY AUNT MARGUERITE MY GRANDMOTHER'S SISTER LIVED IN DOWNTOWN BALTIMORE
AND WHAT TURNS YOU ON IF YOU AIN'T HURTIN' ANYBODY
SPORTS I WAS JUST GONNA SAY I I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW CLOSE YOU MUST LIKE IF SOMEBODY WOULD DISRESPECT YOU ON THE SOCCER FIELD
MY YOUNGER BROTHER ALSO INVITED WAS ABOUT EIGHTEEN AT THE TIME AND WAS EVEN MORE AFFECTED BY THE ABUSE AND ABANDONMENT THAN I WAS
I CAME ACROSS A CHILD MOLESTER AND A RAPIST THAT JUST GOT OUT OF JAIL FROM RAPING A CHILDHOOD FRIEND
AND
I WAS AROUND SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OLD AT THE TIME
I GOT A LOT MORE ATTENTION FROM BOYS OR MEN OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL COLLEGE MALES
DOUBTING MY SANITY WRITES ABOUT HER BIPOLAR KNOWING I COULD GET OUT OF THE HOLE IF I JUST HAD ONE MORE DRINK SCRATCH TICKET EIGHT BALL AND A TEN DOLLAR BILL
AGAIN I'M NOT A THERAPIST BUT I DID
IT'S A GOOD DEAL
AND AH
YOU SOUND LIKE SUCH A
AND UM
THAT MAY BE THE DENSEST SHORTEST
I'D RATHER NOT SPLIT THEM UP I THINK THEY NEED EACH OTHER
THAT WOULD BE FUCKING AWESOME
AND CONFUSED
PRISONERS COULD NOT VOTE NOPE
WHAT I'D PERSONALLY THOUGHT HAD HAPPENED WAS THAT MAYBE FAYE WAS SO TRAUMATIZED BY JOHN KILLING HIMSELF WHILE ON THE PHONE WITH HER IT'S POSSIBLE SHE JUST COULDN'T BRING HERSELF TO MAKE THESE CALLS
THIS IS FILLED OUT BY IT'S NEVER SUNNY IN ROCHESTER AH
I WAS MEANING TO ASK HOW ARE YOUR ALLERGIES
ARMED WHITE MEN ARE STILL AFRAID OF UNARMED BLACK MEN
NOT ONLY POINTING RIGHT BACK
YOU KNOW PEOPLE GET OUT OF THEIR CARS THEIR HEADS ARE BURIED IN THE FLOOR THEIR FACES ARE BURIED IN THE GROUND THEY WALK REALLY SLOW THEIR
UM
BUT I ASKED FAYE IF THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
IF YOU DO
SO
IF SOMEBODY SAYS G OR GARY
BE SCREAMING IN THERAPY AT THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS
THEY TELL ME HE WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE A WRITTEN STATEMENT FROM FAYE OF WHAT JOHN TOLD HER THE NIGHT HE KILLED HIMSELF
ABOUT HER ANOREXIA I AM CURLING UP IN THE ONLY SAFE PLACE
RAISED IN A SLIGHTLY DYSFUNCTIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND I JUST WANTED TO READ TWO THINGS FROM THIS
SHE HELPED ME SURVIVE ONE OF THE WORST NIGHTS OF MY LIFE
AND HE'S STRAIGHT IN HIS TWENTY S
HE UNZIPPED HIS PANTS AND TRIED TO MAKE ME GIVE HIM ORAL SEX BUT I FORCEFULLY GOT OUT OF THE CAR
IF YOU ASK TYLER WHO'S GETTING AWAY WITH SOMETHING THEY SHOULDN'T
ACTUALLY
BIG BATHTUB FULL OF GIN
BUT
AND THIS IS WHERE HOPE COMES BACK INTO THE PICTURE
AND IT HIT MY RIGHT SKATE
EVERYONE IS POINTING AT EVERYONE ONE AFTERNOON AT MY BEST WESTERN ALONG THE HIGHWAY
I LAUGHED WHILE I CRIED AND FREAKED OUT
WHERE MARY GRACE IS LIVING NOW
AND THEN ANOTHER BRIT FROM THE LIST
THERE'S JUST A REGRET AND ALMOST A RESENTMENT THAT I CAN'T FEEL JOY
EVERY EPISODE OF EAR HUSTLE EVEN THESE BONUS EPISODES
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT
FOR THOSE OF US

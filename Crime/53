IT WAS JUST ALSO A UM
MAYBE FIFTEEN YEARS
I THINK THAT'S A GIVEN
YESTERDAY I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK WHEN I SAW A COUPLE A YOUNG COUPLE WALKING THEY SEEMED TO BE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL OR HIGH SCHOOL BASED ON HOW THEY WERE DRESSED THEY GAVE EACH OTHER THAT WE-JUST-STARTED-DATING HUG AND THE GIRL STARTED CROSSING THE STREET
ESSENTIALLY I MADE MYSELF INTO AN ANDROID THAT CATERED TO THEIR DEMANDS WITHOUT QUESTION AND COULD ALSO MAKE ITSELF INVISIBLE WHEN NECESSARY
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I UNDERSTOOD
I'D BE SITTING IN SAN QUENTIN TODAY TALKING ABOUT MY SINS FOR BEING A CHILD MOLESTER I REALLY BELIEVE THAT
NOBODY WANTS TO READ THAT
AND TO LIVE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT YOU GOTTA HAVE SOME HOPE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH IT
SO WE THANK YOU FOR HANGING IN THERE WITH US
KNEW JOHN BEST
GOD IT IS BRINGING UP SUCH INTENSE EMOTIONS
FORTY YEARS AGO WAS LIVING ON SKID ROW IN WINNIPEG AND PICKED HERSELF UP DUSTED HERSELF OFF
AUBREY'S FATHER IS IN PRISON IN PENNSYLVANIA
SO YOU CAN'T WIPE YOUR TEARS AWAY
THIS IS AN AWFUL-SOME MOMENT FILLED OUT BY TOM THOMPSON CAME PADDLING PAST I'M PRETTY SURE IT WAS HIM
THIS IS LIFE IN PRISON
AND PLAY IT FOR THEM
YOU KNOW THE EMOTIONAL PAIN AND SCARS THAT ARE LEFT BEHIND FROM
I COULDN'T GET OUT OF BED AND I KEPT SAYING AFTER THIS EPISODE OF WHATEVER I'M WATCHING I'LL GET UP I'LL RUN THE DISHWASHER I'LL TAKE A SHOWER
DO YOU STILL SEE THAT AS LOVE
SO YOUR PANTS AND YOUR SHIRT ARE LOOKING NICE AND CRISPY
AND HAS ALWAYS HAD A LARGE PERSONALITY BUT SO DO I
TALK TO SOMEBODY THERE ARE TONS OF GREAT WAYS TO PROCESS TRAUMA
YOU ARE UP AGAINST SOMETHING THAT IS HUGE YOU ARE UP AGAINST EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL MANIPULATION BY SOMEBODY WHO SOUNDS MASTERFUL AT IT
YOU KNOW
AND THAT'S WHEN I
YOU KNOW
IT STICKS WITH US
THAT ALLOWED ME TO LET GO OF MY RESENTMENT
I WAS ONCE TOLD THAT MAYBE A SIDE EFFECT OF ME GROWING UP WITHOUT INTERNET PORN AND HAVING TO MASTURBATE MY WAY THROUGH PUBERTY TO THE UNDERWEAR SECTION OF SEARS CATALOGUE MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO ME AND I'M COOL WITH IT
IT WAS
I ALSO ASKED ABOUT THE TEXT MESSAGE TYLER SHOWED ME FROM JOHN WHICH SAID THAT TYLER COULD HAVE ANYTHING HE WANTED IN THE HOUSE
MY PHOTOGRAPHY
HUH WHO'S FI-FI I WOULD TAKE IT FI-FI'S SHORT FOR FELICIA
TOM THINKS JOHN GOT A D OR MAYBE A C IN HIS CHEMISTRY CLASS
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO SOMEONE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO I WANT TO KNOW WHY I WASN'T ENOUGH WHY I'M STILL NOT ENOUGH
AND ALL OF ME WAS INVESTED IN THAT
BUT IT DOES TAKE WORK
AND THE STRANGE THING ABOUT IT IS THAT NOT ONE OF THESE PEOPLE
I'M PAUL GILMARTIN
AH WRITES ABOUT HER ANXIETY JUST THE THOUGHT OF HOW TO FIT ANXIETY INTO A STRUGGLE SENTENCE FUCKING STRESSES ME OUT
YOU KNOW TRANSITIONING TO REAL LIFE WHERE I HAD TO GO OUT AND GET A JOB
SOMETHING MIGHT STILL BE ON OR UNLOCKED AND YOU'RE GONNA SUFFER FINANCIALLY POSSIBLY TO THE POINT OF HOMELESS
I WOULD LOOK DOWN AS I CROSSED ANOTHER STREET AND MEET ITS EYES AND I JUST FELT IMPORTANT AND GOOD AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS I RARELY FEEL IN MY DAY TO DAY LIFE
IF I'M ABLE TO BALANCE MY LIFE CORRECTLY I CAN FEEL THAT AGAIN IN REAL LIFE
THIRTY TO FORTY

TIRED
WHEN I GOT HOME MY MOTHER SCREAMED AT ME WONDERING WHY I WAS HOME EARLY FROM THE NEW JOB AND IMMEDIATELY ACCUSED ME OF GETTING FIRED FOR BEING A STUPID PIECE OF SHIT
THANK YOU
AND IF NEITHER HE NOR THE OTHER FRIEND HEARD FROM JOHN
IT WAS NEARLY THE SAME COLOR AS THE BLUE GREY ASPHALT BUT NOT THE RIGHT SHAPE I WALKED OVER AND THERE SITTING QUITE STILL WAS A LITTLE GREY BIRD
GOOD BYE NOTE THAT LEILA ALCORN LEFT
IN ORDER FOR THEM
MY ROOTS

AND MY TIMING WAS TERRIBLE FOR HIM
THEO SKATED UP TO ME AFTER EVERYTHING GOT BROKEN UP AND HE WAS VERY EMOTIONAL YOU ALMOST NEVER SEE GUYS GET EMOTIONAL ON THE ICE BUT THIS WAS DIFFERENT

YOU KNOW
GO TO PODFEST AND SEE IT IN PERSON OR JUST WATCH IT OVER YOUR COMPUTER LIVE OR ARCHIVED FOR UP TO A MONTH
THE EMOTIONAL CONNECTION TO PEOPLE WHO SHARED MY STORY
AND WHEN SHE BREAKS THOSE BOUNDARIES
I MEAN ON A CERTAIN LEVEL
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL
HEAD DEACONS AN ASSISTANT YOUTH PASTOR

I'M GLAD THAT THAT THAT HAPPENED FOR BOTH OF US THAT
IT'S A NIGHTMARE THAT LEAVES ME FEELING COMPLETELY AWFUL AND I WORRY DEEPLY ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES FOR MY SON
HE ALSO HIT ME A FEW TIMES BUT I HONESTLY DESERVED IT MOST OF THE TIME
I'VE HEARD THAT HE QUIT SCHOOL BECAUSE HE WAS SMARTER THAN THE PROFESSORS
I REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW TO FEEL ABOUT THE TREATMENT I RECEIVED GROWING UP
AND

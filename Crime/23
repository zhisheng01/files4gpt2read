I MAKE THE SHOW TOO HEAVY
AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT I REALLY ENJOYED
HE CREATES A SEXUAL PERVERT HE CREATES A CHILD MOLESTER HIMSELF
SO DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THAT LIKE HE CAN STILL BE IN MY LIFE I CAN STILL MAKE THIS WORK BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE MY PARTNER
AFTER THAT HE EVEN LET ME SMOTHER HIS BEAUTIFUL CHEEKS WITH KISSES
PROMISE ME YOU WON'T BREAK A STICK OVER HIS HEAD
YOUR MIND GET TO THINKING LIKE
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE EFFICIENT
MOST PEOPLE KNOW IS SHOCK THERAPY ABOUT THREE WEEKS INTO THAT I WAS STRUGGLING TO REMEMBER MY NAME AND FAMILY AND EVENTS
AND
EARLONNE HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THAT
AND AGAIN LIKE I SAY ALL THE TIME ON HERE
BEFORE YOU STARTED GETTING HELP
THEN PANICKING AND DESTROYING IT ALL
BUT THIS LAST BIRTHDAY REMINDED ME THAT
MY YOUNGER BROTHER'S A SCIENTIST
WHERE THEIR LACK OF BOUNDARIES MAKES SENSE TO THEM
IT WAS AS IF I GOT EVIDENCE AT THAT MOMENT THAT YES
I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A BREAK
WHEN I WAS EATING A DILL PICKLE AND GAVE ME A PIECE OF PAPER THAT SAID BIRTH CONTROL ON IT ON ONE SIDE AND ON THE OTHER IT SAID KEEP FIRMLY BETWEEN KNEES
MEMORY IN ME IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
CALLING MY FRIENDS HONKIES AND TRIED TO PREVENT ME FROM JOINING THEM
MY WIFE AND I HAD BEEN HERE A WEEK BY THE WAY OH MY GOD YEAH
AND SHE WRITES WHEN I WAS YOUNG AROUND EIGHT OR NINE WARM SUNDAY AFTERNOONS ARE SPENT AT THE RACETRACK
WHEN I
CHRONIC DEPRESSION LOOKING FORWARD TO ABJECT DESPAIR
WELL LET'S BE HONEST I LIKE READING PEOPLE'S SEXUAL FANTASIES
LET'S SAY A STEAK AND BAKED POTATO HE WAS A RUNNER
THE REST IS PRETTY MUCH JUST TEXTBOOK EMOTIONAL NEGLECT
JOEL SAID
HIS WHOLE BODY WAS SHAKING
THE REACTION IN THE FAMILY HAS VARIED GREATLY SOME SEE HIM AS A PEDOPHILE
MY MOM'S AGE WHO WERE NOTHING LIKE HER AND I JUST
LIKE BEING IN PROGRAM AND HAVING THOSE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND YOU IN THIS DIFFERENT WAY
HOW DO YOU FEEL AFTER WRITING THESE THINGS DOWN BEATEN
ABOUT HER TRICHOTILLOMANIA REMEMBER THAT ONE SUBLIME HAIR-PULL FROM WHEN YOU WERE A TEENAGER
ASK YOURSELF
I SAID GRAB YOUR WHAT
WOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM
TO ANYBODY ELSE
AFTER THE CALL I MADE MYSELF GET UP AND SHOWER AND WHEN I DID I FELT A VERTIGO SENSATION AND THESE WEIRD ELECTRIC TINGLES ALL OVER MY BODY AND IT DAWNED ON ME THAT I WAS WITHDRAWING FROM MY MEDS
AND I HOPE YOU I HOPE YOU GET TO HEAR ME
WHEN I FINALLY GAVE WEIGHT TO WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO ME ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL FANTASIES UM
ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH SOMEONE WHO SHARES YOUR THOUGHTS OR EXPERIENCES
UM HE WAS LAID OUT ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH AND THE TWENTY NINTH AND HE WAS BURIED ON NOVEMBER THIRTIETH WHICH IS MY YOUNGER BROTHER'S THIRTEENTH BIRTHDAY
HUGS AND SNUGGLES AND COMPLIMENTS
THAT CLOSENESS WHEN PEOPLE COME TO ME IS
I FEEL SELFISH AND BURDENSOME
THEY WILL CERTAINLY COME TRUE
A CONSTANT BATTLE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL BREWING INSIDE YOUR MIND ALWAYS TRYING TO KEEP THE RAGE BEAST FROM BREAKING THE SURFACE
AND IT WAS WINTER
I GUESS I FORGET THAT
HOW OFTEN DO YOU FEEL THAT
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE TO TURN
IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE MAYBE I'M NOT ALIVE ENOUGH TO HAVE ANYTHING
YOU KNOW
THAT MEANS YOU SHOULD KILL YOURSELF
TO THE EDITED VERSION OF IT BUT THANK GOD YOU DIDN'T HEAR THE UNEDITED VERSION OF IT
IF YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT
AND SO WHEN YOU LEARN HOW TO DO THIS
AH BEFORE I READ SOME SURVEYS
OF COURSE NOT
AND THIS IS FILLED OUT BY
WITH TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING THAT IS EMOTIONAL
WHICH IS THE SAME THING I THOUGHT WHEN JOHN TOLD ME HE WAS GOING TO COMMIT SUICIDE
YOU KNOW
THOSE NICE THINGS
OH THAT MY DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY ARE LIFELONG STRUGGLES FOR ME AND SEEING HIS FACE VISIBLY SINK AS HE REALIZES
I MEAN WE REALLY
IF YOU WANT MY OPINION GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM HER AS SOON AS YOU CAN
AND THAT'S FOUR CELLS AND THEY'RE AWAY FROM EVERYONE ELSE
ALSO SINCE ABOUT THAT AGE I'VE BEEN COPYING PEOPLE'S PERSONAS I WOULD SEE DIFFERENT PEOPLE FRIENDS
THIS HAPPENED WHEN I WAS A FRESHMAN IN HIGH SCHOOL A FRIEND WHO I THOUGHT WAS GENUINELY COOL
YOU KNOW NUMB OUT FEELINGS I LITERALLY DID NOT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO
A FEW MONTHS AGO I MADE THE MISTAKE OF NOT TAKING MY MEDS FOR TWO DAYS IT WAS AN ACCIDENT BUT ONE OF THEM IS EFFEXOR SO IT WAS NOT GREAT
AND IT STAYED COVID FREE
THEY HAVE TOO MUCH TO GET DONE BEFORE THEY HEAD BACK TO FLORIDA THE NEXT DAY
THERE'S A VOICE INSIDE OF ME THAT QUESTIONS WHAT WAS IT ABOUT MY OWN MOM AND DAD THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME
I LIKE THE STORY OF HOW THIS COMPANY WAS STARTED LIKE A LOT OF GOOD PRODUCTS OUT THERE
IN THEIR SLEEP WITH A KNIFE PUSHING STRANGERS ON THE STREET INTO TRAFFIC PUSHING LITTLE KIDS IN FRONT OF BUSES OR DOWN STORM DRAINS
NO IDEA WHAT MINE WAS EITHER
BEFORE I COULD EVEN SPEAK SHE PUT HER ARMS AROUND ME AND GAVE ME ONE OF THE BIGGEST
SO YOU SCREAM DOWN THE TIER ONE TIME YOU KNOW EXCUSE ME
AH GO TO THE OUR WEBSITE YOU CAN FILL OUT A SURVEY
AND TAP DANCING
IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE SYSTEMIC DENIAL OF OUR FAMILY'S ISSUES WAS A HUGE PART OF THE PROBLEM AND THAT I COULD HELP IT TO CONTINUE BY REMAINING SILENT OR I COULD BUCK THE SYSTEM SO I BUCKED
NO I'M GOING TO READ THE WHOLE THING
SENDING YOU SOME LOVE
BECAUSE I LOVE THE POWER I FEEL FROM CHOKING THEM
MY DAD PULLED HIS PANTS DOWN AND LAUGHED
I'M AFRAID THAT I'M NEVER GOING TO
IN UNITED KINGDOM
AND I GUESS THAT GOES WITH YOU KNOW IT'S FIGHT FLIGHT OR FREEZE RIGHT I WAS GOING INTO FREEZE
I LIKE TO THINK THAT I'M A LAIDBACK AND
THAT WE SOMEHOW TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR
HE ALSO USED TO STARE AT MY CHEST AS I WAS DEVELOPING WHICH CAUSED ME TO NOW HAVE ROUNDED SHOULDERS AS I TRIED TO HUNCH TO HIDE MY BREASTS AND HE'D STARE AT MY LEGS IF I EVER WORE SKIRTS OR SHORTS WHICH I NOW NEVER WEAR
THAT WAS THE END OF THE DISCUSSION
UM I WENT FROM BEING THIS PERFECT CURTIS TO THIS CURTIS OF SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
IT'S FROM A GUY NAMED REMUS SAM LANGI REMUS IS IN PRISON FOR MURDER
I DIDN'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF HIS PAST TRAUMA WITH SEXUAL ABUSE NOBODY DID

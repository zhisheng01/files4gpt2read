BUT SOMETHING SNAPPED IN ME MAYBE IT WAS THE THOUGHT OF MY FRIENDS BEING VERBALLY ATTACKED AS OPPOSED TO MYSELF THAT PROMPTED ME
AND ONE LITTLE BOY RAISED HIS HAND AND SAYS I KNOW CHRISTIANA SHE WORKS RIGHT DOWN THE STREET AT THE PIZZA PLACE
YOU'RE NOT IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR US TO BULLSHIT YOU

PEOPLE THINK I'M WEIRD
YOU DON'T THINK IT'S WEIRD THAT I'M ALMOST FORTY AND I'M SITTING HERE BOO-HOOING ABOUT MOMMY SHIT AND HE'S LIKE NO

SMILE A LITTLE MORE
ENJOY IT
HE NEVER BATTED AN EYE AT MY STRANGE INTERESTS
THE PUZZLES WERE A HUGE HIT
THAT I'M GONNA SHRED IN
THIS IS GOING TO MAKE ME SOUND REALLY CRAZY NOT THAT
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD EVER BE SMART FOR ME TO BE ALONE WITH YOUNGER PEOPLE FOR THOSE REASONS
I HAVE THAT ONE
BUT
I HAD MY FIANCE BRING ME JIGSAW PUZZLES AND BOOKS
RAISED IN A SLIGHTLY DYSFUNCTIONAL ENVIRONMENT
UM
THIS WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO GIVE OUR SPONSORS SOME LOVE
I RELATE WITH LIKE HEROIN ADDICTS YOU KNOW LIKE NEEDLE IN YOUR VEIN
YOU HANG UP THE PHONE
I BLAME MYSELF FOR MY PARENTS' ISSUES WITH THEIR MARRIAGE
NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE ME AND IT'S JUST SO TRAGIC WHEN IT'S PARENTS
IT IS SO HEARTBREAKING
YOU'LL BE ASTOUNDED AT HOW INEFFICIENT THE SYSTEM IS
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE I'M GAY
JUST KEEP TRYING

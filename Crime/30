I VALUE RELATIONSHIPS ONLY WHEN THEY'RE OVER
SO
THIS WAS HOW I FOUND OUT MY PARENTS TRIED TO ABORT ME
I LEFT THE PUZZLES THERE WHEN I WAS RELEASED
YOU KNOW ONCE TWO GLASSES WERE DOWN HER
WHAT'S IN THE BOX
BACK TO HIS CHILDHOOD BEDROOM
NOT EIGHT
YOU KNOW THIS DOCUMENTARY
DARKEST THOUGHTS I'VE HAD VIOLENT RAPE FANTASIES WHERE I'M THE AGGRESSOR AND THE VICTIM SHOWS THE SAME FEELINGS AND FACIAL STRUCTURE THAT I PROBABLY HAD WHILE BEING FORCED TO ENDURE MY OWN ABUSES
HE SAW
I FELT A SENSE OF LOSS FOR MY OWN SEXUALITY AND LIKE AM I JUST A PROP
HER PARENTS
THIS IS AMELIA WHOSE HUSBAND IS IN CORCORAN STATE PRISON IN CALIFORNIA
HE CAME TO SEE ME THROUGH THE CHECK IN PROCESS AFTER A FEW HOURS
DEEPEST DARKEST SECRETS I DON'T LIKE SEX I JUST DON'T
I WAS GONNA PUT DOWN A BAND BY SAYING
I'D DONE YEARS OF THERAPY AT THIS POINT AND FELT STRONG ENOUGH TO TAKE A CHANCE
THAT NIGHT AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN
THOUGH MAYBE I DO KNOW
AND UM
HE LIVED IN UTAH
AND I PICK IT UP AND IT'S SISTER CARMINA
BUT YOU KNOW CALGARY HAD A REALLY SORT OF ESTABLISHED VETERAN TEAM THAT WERE
AND HE SAID TO ME I WAS SIXTEEN TENTH GRADE
HE FEELS THE COURTS AND COPS AND LAWYERS HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT VICTIMIZE HIM SINCE HE BECAME A TEENAGER
OUR HOPES GO UP OUR HOPES GO DOWN
WE LEARN THAT YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEBODY COMES INTO THE ROOM AND THEY'RE ANGRY
I STOPPED HIM AND PROMISED TO HELP HIM LEARN TO SHUFFLE OUT OF HABIT I FANNED THE DECK
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
AGAIN MOMS AND WOMEN WHO WERE OLDER
TO OLDER LADIES SUFFERING A LITTLE DEMENTIA
HOW LITTLE SUPPORT IS GIVEN TO ILLITERATE PEOPLE AND DRUG USERS WHEN THIS WOULD OBVIOUSLY STOP THEM RE-OFFENDING UPON RELEASE
THIS SHOW IS NOT MEANT TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MENTAL COUNSELING I'M NOT A THERAPIST
SO WHEN MY BOYFRIEND IS DOING HIS OWN THING I GET UPSET WITH HIM AND WANT HIM TO PAY ATTENTION TO ME
I THINK THERE'S LESSONS YOU KNOW THAT WE CAN ALL LEARN FROM
YOU KNOW
HERE IT STILL COMES
I THINK IT'S A SHAME MY FAMILY DIDN'T GET ONE WAY EARLIER
I WANT SOMEONE TO LOOK AT THAT NUMBER AND SAY THAT'S FUCKED UP AND FIX IT
I HOPE IT CONFUSED YOU
BEFORE I GET SO HUNGRY THAT I BINGE AGAIN
NOT LOVEABLE
WHERE I GO OH I'M ALLOWED TO FEEL MAD AT MY AGENT RIGHT NOW I'M ALLOWED TO FEEL LIKE I NEED A BOUNDARY HERE
CUPID STUNT
THAT'S NOT WHAT'S IMPORTANT WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU WERE OBJECTIFIED AND SEXUALIZED AND I KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE AND
AND UM I GET HERE AND AGAIN I'M HOMELESS NOW BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A DORM TO GO TO
BUT
THIS SHOW IS NOT MEANT TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MENTAL COUNSELING
YOU KNOW WHEN I READ THAT ONE I WAS LIKE I THINK I'M THE OPPOSITE WHEN MY DEPRESSION IS KICKING MY ASS
SHE'S JUST A NORMIE
GOT SOBER SEPTEMBER EIGHTEENTH OF TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE AND
THIS IS AN AWFUL-SOME MOMENT FILLED OUT BY
HE PICKED UP AS I WAS LEAVING A MESSAGE
BY THE WAY HERBERT'S BUTTHOLE IS DOING VERY WELL
FOR THIS EPISODE
I FEEL LIKE
YEAH SO FISHIN' IS A FORM OF COMMUNICATION IT'S
THAT ADDS TO THE NOT WANTING TO WAKE UP BECAUSE IT'S LIKE I DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP AGAIN AND FEEL LIKE
HAVING THEM SEE THEO FIND HIS VOICE AND BE ABLE TO SHARE HIS VOICE
UN-FUCKING-BELIEVABLE
I WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT PERFECTLY CALM BUT MY BODY IS THRASHING AROUND SCREAMING THAT WE MESSED UP AGAIN AND I HAVE TO GRAB HOLD OF HER PACIFY HER AND ROCK HER BACK TO SLEEP SO THAT I CAN GO BACK TO SLEEP TOO
OBVIOUSLY I HAD SALINE IMPLANTS AND APPARENTLY IT'S SAFE FOR THE EMPTY BAGS TO REMAIN THE THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY MY THERAPISTS AND DOCTORS DIDN'T BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAID I WOULD DO IT MYSELF
GEORGE W BUSH WAS RUNNING FOR HIS SECOND TERM
MY OLDEST BROTHER RAN OFF AT SIXTEEN AND MY MIDDLE BROTHER HAD TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME GETTING HIS SHIT TOGETHER AND I KNOW THAT TOOK IT OUT OF HER
PUSH HIM AROUND GET IN HIS FACE AND JUST ACT VERY FRIGHTENING AND ANGRY WITH HIM
WE DON'T NEED THIS WE DON'T NEED THAT WE DON'T NEED THIS AND HE WAS THROWING AND THESE PIECES WERE COMING OFF THE CLOCK AND FLYING OVER TO THE TABLE
AND HOW MANY GENUINELY GOOD-HEARTED PEOPLE YOU END UP MEETING
SO
I COULD FEEL ITS LITTLE HEART BEATING AGAINST MY FINGERS THOUGH I NOTICED IT WASN'T POUNDING
I-IT SUCKS FOR MY FATHER
AFTER AVOIDING US MOST OF THE EVENING HE SUDDENLY APPEARED AND PULLED MY BROTHER AND I TO THE DANCE FLOOR
THAT INTERESTING
DON'T YOU DARE ROB ME OF MY HAPPINESS GOING FORWARD
MY MOTHER WAS HEATING UP APPETIZERS AND WHEN THE MICROWAVE BEEPED E LOOKED UP FROM THE LIVING ROOM THEN MADE A BEELINE FOR THE KITCHEN
I HOPE YOU'RE TALKING TO SOMEBODY ABOUT THIS
SHE WRITES MANY OF MY SCHOOL PICTURES IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND MIDDLE SCHOOL I AM SPORTING AN AWFUL TERRIBLE PERM
ALL RIGHT
THE FEAR OF ALWAYS BEING DEPRESSED
WOULD YOU VIEW THAT AS NO BIG DEAL NO
AH
THAT HE WOULD NEVER HAVE ACTUALLY GONE THROUGH WITH IT IF AN ACTUAL THIRTEEN YEAR OLD HAD ANSWERED THE DOOR INSTEAD OF A DETECTIVE
BECAUSE THAT'S WHY WE LOB THOSE BAD THREE POINTERS WHEN THE WASTE PAPER BASKET IS TEN FEET AWAY FROM THE DOOR
A HUG
EVENTUALLY DIGGING THEM UP FROM HER GRAVE
WOW
LIFE FOR CURTIS IN PRISON IS
BUT THERE WAS
I COULD TALK ABOUT MY MENTAL ILLNESS AND MY MEDICATIONS AROUND MY FAMILY AND OTHER PEOPLE LIKE IT WAS ANY OLD REGULAR MEDICAL CONDITION
AND THAT IS TRAUMA
HOLD YOU BETWEEN ROUNDS
SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH ME
WALKING AROUND THE CITY WHILE LISTENING TO PODCASTS
JUST
IT'S RETA AND TWO OTHER WOMEN WHO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES AS COUSINS OF JOHN'S AS WELL AS RETA'S HUSBAND CHARLIE
RELATIONSHIP ARE HARD EXCLAMATION POINT
A TON OF WORK WENT INTO THIS
AND SHE WRITES ABOUT HER DEPRESSION
I THINK THAT IF I WOULD EVER GET SICK IN PUBLIC I WILL KILL MYSELF
AND THEN JUST FACE I MEAN FACE FIRST RIGHT ON HER NOSE BROKE HER NOSE KNOCKED HER TEETH OUT

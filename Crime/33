WE PLAYED SOCCER
I I
THERE IS NO AMOUNT OF WILLPOWER THAT
TOLD ME THAT JOHN SENT A COPY TO HER AS PART OF HIS INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE HE DRANK CYANIDE
HAPPY AND PLAYFUL
TERROR THAT IF I HAD A BABY MY LIFE WOULD BE RUINED THAT MY BOYFRIEND OF ONLY A FEW MONTHS WOULD ABANDON ME TO RAISE A CHILD ON MY OWN AND I WOULD BE TRAPPED IN MY DEAD END JOB INDEFINITELY AND DOOMED TO LIVE IN POVERTY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
WERE YOU AFRAID THEY WERE GOING TO MENTION IT
I CAN'T IMAGINE
SEEING MY FLABBY-ASSED FATHER
ALLEN HAVE BEEN OUT OF TOWN FOR A WATCH AND CLOCK CONVENTION SHORTLY BEFORE JOHN DIED
YOU KNOW
INSTEAD I TOOK A DEEP BREATH
AND AH
I COULDN'T RESIST I'M SORRY
WOULD YOU LIVE NEXT TO SOMEONE WHO DID TIME FOR A SEX OFFENSE
HOW MUCH STUFF GETS THROWN OVER THE WALL AND HOW EASILY THEY COULD PREVENT IT IF THEY ACTUALLY WANTED TO
AND I'M SORRY FOR THE WAY I AM
I STARTED TO SEE STARS
I'D LIKE TO TELL MY EX-BOYFRIEND THAT HIS CONCEPT OF BEING A GENTLEMAN IS BULLSHIT
IT'S THE OPENING UP
MY QUOTE MOTHER
IT'S BEEN THE SAME THING
THE ENTIRE THREE HOURS MASTURBATING AND LOOKING FOR PENIS
YOU KNOW
I CAN'T COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH THAT BUT THERE'S SOME AWESOME AWESOME PEOPLE WE JUST GOTTA TAKE SOME EFFORT TO FIND THEM
LITTLE WRITES ABOUT HER ANXIETY LIKE I'M CONSTANTLY WALKING IN TWO FEET OF WATER PUSHING ALONG AND THEN THE TIDE COMES IN
THAT IS A HUGE RED FLAG FOR YOU TO GET HELP
BUSY PLACE
I'VE HEARD THAT HE HAD TO LEAVE AFTER BLOWING UP A LABORATORY
I'VE NEVER HAD A PET BEFORE AND AS SOMEONE WHO HAS EXTREME SOCIAL ANXIETY
SHE IS IN HER TWENTY S
NOT ACTUALLY FIGHT
I TOLD THEM WHERE I WAS
TO NOT GIVE HER MORE MONEY
AND AS YOU KNOW FROM BEING IN A SUPPORT GROUP
I'VE NEVER FELT SO PROUD OF ANYTHING I'VE MADE BEFORE UNTIL I SAW HER CUTE LITTLE SMILE WHEN SHE SAW THAT WE MATCHED
AND WE WON'T BLAME YOU IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LISTEN ANY FURTHER
WHICH
I LITERALLY HAD NOTHING
THE ARGUMENTS WOULD START MY DAD'S VERY PASSIVE
YOU KNOW
IT'S SECRET THAT I'M GAY
YOU KNOW I SHOULD'VE GONE INTO FLIGHT
INITIALLY THE HOSPITAL WOULDN'T LET MY FATHER BRING ME A SANDWICH BECAUSE HE COULD HIDE SOMETHING IN IT OR SOMETHING
YOU KNOW WHAT IF I DO NEED THIS
I COULD HANDLE MYSELF ENOUGH
AND I MEAN THIS MAN LITERALLY DIED FOR HIS KIDS AND UM
REALLY GOOD CONSTRUCTION
AND HAD BEEN VERY FRIENDLY TOWARDS ME FOR THE FEW WEEKS I KNEW HER
IT IS DRY
YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SEE THAT
I FELT THE SICKNESS OF DEATH IN THE PIT OF MY STOMACH BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH TO DO WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE
IN HER THIRTY S
I GET IT
BASICALLY
VERY SHORT GUIDE TO SHOPPING
WHAT DID HE DO
JUST THE FACT THAT YOU'RE THERE
I THINK THAT I FEEL IT LESS THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
AND THE TRANS THING MAKES ME FEEL BAD CAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS CONSIDERED MYSELF TOTALLY STRAIGHT AND I USED TO HAVE BETTER THOUGHTS
I WAS JUST FLASHING BACK TO THAT
THEO CAME OUT OF THE TUNNEL AND MET ME AT THE PREARRANGED SPOT
SO HOW CAN YOU ASK FOR FORGIVENESS IF YOU STILL HAVE THE FEELING THAT WHAT YOU DID WASN'T WRONG
ANY COMMENTS TO MAKE THE PODCAST BETTER I'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM MEN WHO HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH BPD
YOUR LIFE IS CHARMED
I WAS BROKEN
TATTOOED IN ME AS A CHILD AND
BE INTIMATE WITH SOMEBODY TO LET SOMEBODY IN
RYAN GOSLING AND EMMA STONE JUST THEY HAVE SUCH GREAT CHEMISTRY
HE SAID MY FI-FI BAG
YOU GET IT WHEN YOU'RE HAVING A HAMBURGER AT A BAR HEY FRASER
BUT
THIS IS A SHAME AND SECRET SURVEY FILLED OUT BY
DOES SHE WANT ME TO BLOW A LOAD IN HER EMAIL ADDRESS
YOU KNOW WE'LL WE'LL GET HIM A GOOD HOME TO LIVE IN AT FOURTEEN YOU WOULD BE PLAYING WITH SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS AH
WHEN YOU DECIDE TO SIGN UP FOR SQUARESPACE
NOT SO THAT YOU CAN BRING IT TO HIM AND MAKE HIM FEEL BADLY
AND SOCIETAL DECLINE AND OH AT ONE POINT AS HE'S SHOWING ME THIS MATERIAL
I WOULD LISTEN TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND
I REFUSE TO WEAR CONTACTS BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE MY GLASSES HIDE MY DARK CIRCLES IF ONLY A LITTLE
AND THEN GAVE ME A HUG
I'M NOT CRAZY BUT I HAVE A STORY TO TELL YOU
ALL YOU CAN BE IS THAT
AND READING BOOKS
SHUT
HARD
HADN'T DONE DRUGS IN X DAYS
I
SO TAKE WHATEVER I SAY ON THE MATTER WITH A QUARRY FULL OF SALT AMAZINGLY TRANS PEOPLE HAVE A VARIETY OF EXPERIENCES
SO FAR
UM PIECE
CLEAR LINEAR
RIGHT
THAT I WOULDN'T
PLAYING TO MY MOOD I HAVE ALSO PICKED UP A FEW OTHER INSTRUMENTS AND WORKING ON LEARNING TO PLAY BANJO FIFE AND HARMONICA
THIS IS STRUGGLE IN A SENTENCE FILLED OUT BY S AND SHE'S A TEENAGER
I THINK EVERYONE DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE AND I SAID I AGREE
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS LIKE REST AND RELAXING
UM
TO WAIL

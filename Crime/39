AND AFTER THAT SHE TURNED ON HER CAMERA
AND HONESTLY I FOUND IT REALLY FRUSTRATING
AND FOR THE SECOND TIME I FIND MYSELF EMBARKING ON AN INVESTIGATION AT THE BEHEST OF AN ALABAMIAN HOROLOGIST
SETTING PEOPLE ON FIRE IT'S SO STRANGE BECAUSE IN REAL LIFE I'M SUCH A PACIFIST
SHE TELLS ME IT'S STRANGE THAT IT WAS SENT FROM JOHN'S COMPUTER AND NOT A CELL PHONE
ALL THOSE THINGS THAT I'D WANNA ASK
IT'S SO HARD TO JUST SIT WITH THEM IN THEIR PAIN AND NOT TRY TO
THAT WILL MAKE YOU SHUDDER IN FEAR
IN OUR CULTURE IN OUR SOCIETY
MY FIRST DAY WAS TERRIFYING
THIS IS
AND IT JUST BECAME BUT I BUT I
AIN'T NOBODY COMING TO RESCUE CURTIS
BEFORE AND DURING BEING A FLIGHT ATTENDANT
FOUNDATION THAT KEEPS THIS SHOW OPERATING ARE THE DONATIONS AND YOU CAN SIGN UP TO BE A MONTHLY DONOR FOR AS LITTLE AS FIVE BUCKS A MONTH AND IT MEANS THE WORLD TO ME
I DIDN'T SEE THE GUY WHO THREW HIS HELMET AT ME AND CALLED ME EVERY NAME IN THE BOOK OVER THE YEARS
DON'T KNOW
INTERNALLY I WANTED TO SCREAM MY CRAZY MOTHER GOT DRUNK AND THIS IS HER PASTIME AND CRY BECAUSE SHE LAUGHED AT ME
I'M ALMOST ANGRY AT MY FRIENDS FOR BEING CONCERNED
JOHN USED TO SAY WELL GOT TO GO DIG UP SOME MORE MONEY
IT'S STILL NOT YOUR FUCKING FAULT
YOU KNOW SOCIETY'S GOING TO COME ALONG AND THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS AND IT'S THEY'RE JUST GOING TO CORRECT ALL THIS AND THEN WHEN THE RAPE HAPPENED IT WAS LIKE
YOU KNOW IS EVERYTHING OK AND I SAID
THIS IS
I'M GONNA SHOW UP AND NOW I'M GONNA REPENT FOR WHAT
IT'S BEEN A COUPLE OF YEARS SINCE I WAS ABLE TO GET COUNSELING BECAUSE I LOST MY JOB
IN AH
SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD MOTIVATE ME TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD TO DO THINGS AND MEET PEOPLE
AND I'M AT MISS SANDY'S HOUSE SANDY WHO I TOLD YOU WAS LIKE MY MOTHER I'M SLEEPING AT HER HOME AND SHE SHAKES ME AWAKE IN THE MORNING
THAT'S FUNNY
IN A WORD
THIS WEEK IN PARTICULAR I MADE A PAN SEARED COD AND PICKLED GRAPE WITH SUMMER BEAN SUCCOTASH
SHE LIKES HUGGING ME WHO DOESN'T LIKE HUGGING ME
I CAN TALK ABOUT IT
THE NEXT WEEKEND MY PARENTS CALLED AND I WAS LYING ON MY BED HANGING OUT WITH MY CAT I TALKED TO MY MOM FIRST
OH LAST WEEK YOU WERE HAVING REALLY BAD ALLERGIES ARE THEY BETTER NOW
YES
THE TUBE HAS TO WEIGHT ENOUGH TO WHERE
YOU KNOW HERE I AM
I'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE MAYBE SHORTER SEGMENTS THAT HAVE COME FROM STABLE HOMES BUT ARE STILL FUCKED UP
AND SHE IS
I'M MARRYING FOR LOVE I'M GONNA STUDY PHILOSOPHY
HE'S NOT EXACTLY SURE WHO
SO THANKS FOR PUTTING THE WORD OUT THERE I'M GOING TO SEE IF I CAN TRY GROUP AS WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH I LOVE THE PODCAST
SOME OTHER TYPE OF GEOMETRIC DEVICE THAT IS FAILING ME AT THIS MOMENT BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK INTO THIS GRACE BECAUSE
HOROLOGICAL FIELD
ARE YOU SERIOUS SHE SAYS
THIS IS SHAME AND SECRETS SURVEY FILLED OUT BY A GUY WHO CALLS HIMSELF WAYNE
RIGHT OVER THE HILL
I ACTUALLY TRIED EATING IT
WHAT YOU MAY ASK
YOU KNOW SO ENTHUSIASTIC AND HAD A LOT OF CHARISMA AND
NOT BEING LIKED
WE ALL HAVE EM
UM
SHE WOULD SHOWER AFFECTION TOWARDS ME ONE MINUTE THEN BERATE ME THE NEXT CALLING ME LAZY GOOD-FOR-NOTHING EVIL AND CURSING ME OUT EVERY CHANCE SHE GOT
I HOPE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER OUT HERE
SO
I FEEL LIKE AN AWFUL PERSON BECAUSE HE DESERVES SOMEONE SO MUCH BETTER THAN ME
AND THEN
I FELT SAD
THEY'RE PRESENT EVERY DAY ALL THE TIME IT'S ONE LONG GREY STORY
THAT I COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED FROM MY BODY
OR ACTS IN MANY OF OUR
ANGER
THAT'S PRISONER RICHIE MORRIS WITH DWIGHT KRIZMAN AND CHARLIE SPENCER
SNAPSHOT FROM THEIR LIFE WHEN I WAS IN SIXTH GRADE I BEFRIENDED A GIRL IN MY LUNCH PERIOD THROUGH ANOTHER FRIEND IT TURNED OUT THAT THIS GIRL AND I HAD BEEN CLOSE FRIENDS SINCE SECOND GRADE
I THINK JUST
YOU KNOW SORT OF BEING SELFISH AND SELF-CENTERED WHICH IS PART OF YOU KNOW THE DISEASE OF ALCOHOLISM
THAT MY PARENTS WERE IN SUCH WEIRD DENIAL
THAT YOU DEEP DOWN KNEW THAT YOU SHOULD BE GETTING TREATED LIKE THE BEAD AND THE CLOSEST THAT YOU COULD COME TO DOING IT WAS TO DO IT
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW I WAS JUST SORT OF
OR ROMANTIC
THAT IS
THEO SKATES OVER TO ME AND SAYS
LEAVING DISAPPOINTED AND HOPING AGAINST HOPE TO NOT GET FLUSTERED AND PANICKY BEFORE WORK
I ALWAYS SAY TO PEOPLE IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE
AND THAT'S HIS REAL LIFE
I WORRIED SOMETIMES ABOUT WHAT WILL KICK OFF MY NEXT DEPRESSIVE EPISODE
I COULDN'T STOP THE MENTAL IMAGERY FROM PLAYING OVER AND OVER IN MY HEAD
I JUST REALLY WANT HIM TO BREAK UP WITH ME I FEEL NOTHING FOR HIM
FINALLY
ONE'S YELLOW AND ONE'S BLUE
WHAT ABOUT SHARING WITH HER
YOU KNOW
HUGGING SOMEBODY THAT KNOWS WHAT I EXPERIENCED FELT LIKE
SOOT
SO UM WE'RE GOING TO GET TO AH THE INTERVIEW WITH THEO
WOW I DON'T KNOW WHO SAID THAT
YOU KNOW
HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THE JUDGMENT THAT COMES YOUR WAY AND HOW DO YOU REENGAGE WITH THEIR SPOUSE AFTER LEARNING ABOUT WHAT HE DID
BUT THERE'S THIS FEELING OF
OH MAN
I'M AFRAID THAT WHEN MY DEPRESSION HITS HARD I WON'T BE ABLE TO BE TALKED DOWN
HE'S CERTAIN THERE MUST BE A REASON HE WASN'T CONTACTED ABOUT JOHN'S DEATH
LIKE ALL EIGHT OF US THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THAT FIRST VICTOR WALK YOU SEE US IN THE MOVIE AND YOU SEE US NOW WE'RE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PEOPLE
YOU CAN DO THIS
YEAH WE AH
SO AS THE PARADE PASSED US
YOU KNOW THANKFUL THAT I HAVE ANOTHER DAY

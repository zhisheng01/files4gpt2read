IF SO DID HE SAY WHERE IT WAS
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT ON THIS EPISODE
I CALLED THIS EVENT TUBA TIME AND EVERY TIME I HEARD THAT STUPID FUCKING CASSETTE AT SOME UNGODLY HOUR
HE WASN'T ARRESTED UNTIL HE WAS SEVENTEEN
THE CLENCH IN THE JAW
AND FOUR YEARS ON
I DON'T GENERALLY INQUIRE AFTER MY FRIEND'S GENITALIA CIS OR TRANS
AMAZING WHAT YOU'LL BELIEVE AS A DUMB KID
I CAN'T IMAGINE I CAN'T IMAGINE
OUT OF OBLIGATION
BECAUSE IT MADE NO FUCKING DIFFERENCE I MEAN NOTHING
WHAT WOULD YOUR ANXIETY AND FEAR
AGAIN TO THE LISTENER OUT THERE
MAN THAT IS A HAPPY MOMENT
A LOT OF TIMES WE ARE AFRAID
MY TEMPER IS AMAZING
WELL IN HINDSIGHT
AND
HUMANITY IS COMPLICATED YOU ARE MORE THAN ONE THING
MY BED IS MY BEST FRIEND ON THE FRONT AND MY BRAIN IS MY WORST BULLY ON THE BACK
THOSE ARE MY FEELINGS MY FEELINGS ARE FUCKING VALID
BUT SOMETIMES YOU KNOW THEY FIGURE IT'S JUST A PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING
HEAR YOU'RE SAYING BUT I'VE
FILLED OUT BY A WOMAN NAMED SPIRO AND I JUST WANT TO READ AN EXCERPT FROM IT BECAUSE IT TOUCHED ME
YOU KNOW WE HAVE THESE THINGS IN OUR BRAIN CALLED MIRROR NEURONS AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT
HERE'S HOW CURTIS GOT HIS THIRD STRIKE
I DON'T LIKE YOUR CHANCES
THAT WE WOULD BE OKAY
CIVIL RIGHTS ARE NOT A CONSIDERATION OF THE UNDER-NOURISHED
AND RESPOND TO YOUR NEEDS AND LIVING WITH SOMEONE WHO IS ALL TALK
LITERALLY HE WASHED HIS MOUTH OUT WITH SOAP
AFTER A FEW WEEKS HE SEEMED TO IMPROVE AT THANKSGIVING I WAS AMAZED AT HOW MUCH I COULD UNDERSTAND HIM AND HE WAS EVEN WALKING WITHOUT A WALKER BY CHRISTMAS I WAS TELLING PEOPLE THAT I FELT LIKE I GOT MY DAD BACK
IT DID BRING ME A LOT OF COMFORT I THOUGHT THAT WAS AWESOME BECAUSE IT WAS
TELLING MY STORY ANYBODY THAT WOULD LISTEN YOU KNOW
ABOUT HER LOVE ADDICTION PLEASE TELL ME I'M BEAUTIFUL
DARKEST SECRETS I'VE NEVER SPOKEN ABOUT THE THINGS WITH MY FATHER I FEEL LIKE I WOULDN'T BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY OR THAT IT WOULD BE MY FAULT SOMEHOW
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN PHYSICALLY OR EMOTIONALLY ABUSED
SITUATIONS
AND
THAT IS JUST
THIS IS A WE'RE IN THE HOME STRETCH
COOK MY OWN MEALS DO MY LAUNDRY I HAD NO CLUE RIGHT YOU KNOW
SO CHECK IT OUT IT'S LESS THAN TEN BUCKS PER MEAL
YEAH
MY BEING A STUBBORN DICK AND COMING OUT ABOUT MY HOSPITALIZATION AND MY ILLNESS ACTUALLY BROUGHT MY FAMILY TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN TALK ABOUT OUR FEELINGS MORE
SOME PEOPLE IT'S DECADES
UM
TWO MONTHS AFTER HE WAS RELEASED FROM SAN QUENTIN
TO WHICH I WOULD SAY
ON THIS EPISODE WE'RE DOING SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
IT DESTROYED MY LIFE
THAT GIVES ME HOPE BECAUSE IF THEY CAN MAKE IT TO SEVENTY FIVE AND KNOW SOMETHING BETTER
THANK YOU TO THAT AMERICAN HANDSOME GENTLEMAN
SOMETHING SWITCHED BACK
SHE IS
I HAVE ALWAYS CARRIED THAT ABILITY THROUGH MY LIFE AND STILL TODAY I FACE HARD THINGS AND MY MOTHER CURLS UP ON THE COUCH AND WAITS FOR ME TO HANDLE HER EMOTIONS
AND THERE'S SOMETHING TOO ABOUT THE FALL
I KNOW ALL MENTAL ILLNESSES ARE BUT
ALRIGHT LET'S GET TO SOME FUCKING HAPPY SHIT
I DON'T GO ANYWHERE DURING THIS CRISIS EXCEPT WORK AND THE GROCERY STORE
ASKING HIM WHAT I WOULD ASK HIM NOW
AND YOU WILL BE AMAZING
THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT WHAT I WANT EVEN THOUGH WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE MOMENTS WHERE YOU WANT TO RUN AWAY AND DRIVE INTO THE OCEAN
AT THE CORE OF WHO WE ALL ARE AS HUMAN BEINGS IS WE'RE
ABOUT
AND
TO A WOMAN BROUGHT IN AFTER DRUNKENLY ASSAULTING HER BOYFRIEND
I DIDN'T REALIZE UNTIL TWO YEARS AGO THAT THERE HAD BEEN OVERT SEXUAL ABUSE WHEN I WAS SEVEN I WAS A COMPULSIVE MASTURBATOR AND WAS EVEN DOING IT DURING SCHOOL
HAVING SAID THAT
APPARENTLY THIS INFORMATION CAME TO TYLER FROM BOOZER JOHN'S LAWYER BOOZER SAID
A MAGNET WELL I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT BECAUSE AS YOU'RE DESCRIBING THE WORLD
IF YOU FEEL SO INCLINED AND WE CAN ALWAYS USE
THAT ALL-TOO-FAMILIAR TIGHTNESS IN MY CHEST
SHE GOT UP TO PHONE SOMEONE AND LET OUT A HUGE FART IN FRONT OF MY FACE AND SAID EXCUSE ME
HE ALSO TALKED CLEARLY ABOUT PUTTING TOGETHER A WILL SO IT WAS SHOCKING TO FRIENDS TO LEARN THAT APPARENTLY THERE WASN'T ONE
AND AH
JUST DON'T DON'T TELL YOURSELF THAT YOU'RE A PIECE OF SHIT OR YOU'RE A BAD PERSON
IRRESPECTIVE OF THE OUTCOME
LOPSIDED THE SURVEYS TONIGHT WITH ONES WHERE THERE ARE UM
NOT ACKNOWLEDGING HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS PRISON
MY DEATH NEEDS TO MEAN SOMETHING
AND IN ATTEMPT TO FILL THIS EMOTIONAL VOID
YOU KNOW TEN CELLS AWAY
WE GET HIM IN THEY RUSH HIM UP
I FEEL REALLY CONFIDENT IN MY ORAL SEX SKILLS SO I FEEL LIKE I WOULD END UP FEELING GOOD ABOUT MYSELF
BUT THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA SO THAT WAS WHAT WENT DOWN
AND THAT ALLOWS OTHER PEOPLE TO
THAT I AM NOT ALONE
THEY DON'T ALLOW ME TO RECORD
OH YEAH AND YOU'RE ALSO BEFORE YOU GO INTO DECEPTICON
BUT I
YOU KNOW
YOU KNOW I LEARNED THE IMPORTANCE OF TEAM I LEARNED THE IMPORTANCE OF WINNING
UM
GET HELP
SO SHE HAD GONE THROUGH WHAT I NEEDED TO GO THROUGH
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO HAVING THOSE KIND OF INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS AND I HOPE YOU DON'T JUDGE YOURSELF FOR THAT
I THINK I JUST GOT OUT OF SURVIVAL MODE LIKE THIS YEAR
AND THEN IT WAS DATING I MEAN MY BROTHER WAS INTO LIKE DEREK WAS INTO CARS
WELL IT'S VERY RANDOM LIKE YOU JUST SAID IT'S LIKE THESE WEIRD MOMENTS WHERE LIKE I COULD BE HAVING COFFEE WITH A FRIEND IT'S JUST LIKE EVERYTHING IS OKAY

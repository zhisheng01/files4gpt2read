HAVEN'T SAID IT IN AWHILE
BI-SEXUAL IN HER TWENTY S RAISED IN A PRETTY DYSFUNCTIONAL ENVIRONMENT
WHEN I REFUSED TO RESPOND SHE LEFT MY ROOM AND NEVER TRIED IT AGAIN
I'M JUST SO SAD AND ANGRY ALL THE TIME
THEIR COMMUNICATION LASTED LESS THAN A YEAR
HE WAS VERY FULL OF HIMSELF AND REMARKED THAT HIS SISTER WAS MENTALLY ILL AND SHE ASCRIBED IT TO A HARDER UPBRINGING THAN HIS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE ME GO OFF ON THAT BUT
SIMPLE WAY USE THE HAND
AND A LOT OF TIMES WE
UM
YOU KNOW AH SUMMERTIME CAME AND THIS PARTICULAR SCOUT CAME TO MY HOUSE AND SAT MY PARENTS DOWN AT THE KITCHEN TABLE AND BASICALLY SAID YOU KNOW
AND
WHENEVER I'D CONFRONT HER ABOUT IT AND TELL HER HOW IT MADE ME FEEL SHE NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY IT FIT MY DEPRESSION
SO THEY CHARGE YOU
I TALK TO MYSELF ALL THE TIME WHAT DO YOU SAY
THAT SAID
I'D LOVE TO TALK MORE WITH YOU ABOUT THAT
HE PLANTED THAT SEED OF HUMOR AND RELEASE AND FUNNY AND COMEDY AND DANGER HE INTRODUCED ME TO DANGERFIELD AND CARLIN AND COSBY AND ON AND ON
WHO CARES WHY YOU'RE LIKE THAT
LET'S JUST SAY OUR RELATIONSHIP WASN'T THE BEST
RETA AND CHARLIE SAY FAYE HASN'T PASSED ALONG ANY INSTRUCTIONS TO THEM FROM JOHN
HAVE YOU SHARED THESE THINGS WITH OTHERS I'VE SHARED A BIT WITH MY GIRLFRIEND AND SHE WAS UNDERSTANDING SHE'S ENCOURAGING ME TO GET AWAY FROM MY MOM
I FEEL LIKE MAYBE I MADE THIS ALL UP MAYBE THIS IS JUST MY CRAZY BRAIN MY BIRTH FATHER HAS CONFIRMED ALL MY MEMORIES
AS ANYBODY ELSE
I WISH I WAS SMARTER AND STRONGER
WHERE THEY DON'T
WHICH WOULD MADE COMPLETE SENSE TO ME AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD UNDERSTAND
COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE
SHE WRITES AT MY FIRST JOB
IN WHICH CASE
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT NORMAL IS BUT
AS MY FRIEND AND I DROVE HOME IN HIS TOYOTA PICKUP
INTO GIVING YOU MONEY
PERHAPS EVEN ASHAMED
WHEN HE WAS STILL ALIVE GO GO GO
WE GAVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ANONYMOUSLY AND TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHERE HE WAS COMING FROM
AND HE SNAPPED TOO BUT I REALLY SNAPPED
THAT THING THAT SEXUALLY
WHERE CAN YOU FIND HELP
SOCIALLY ISOLATING AT HOME
THIS IS A HAPPY MOMENT FILLED OUT BY LILAC
YOU KNOW
I FELT GENTLE AND KIND AND REALIZED THAT AT LEAST IN THESE LITTLE MOMENTS I AM CAPABLE AND OKAY
INTERPERSONAL STUFF
IT'S THEN OUR RESPONSIBILITY WHICH SEEMS LIKE IT SUCKS BUT IT'S THE
I WANTED IT TO BE MORE THAN JUST A SOUNDING BOARD AT THAT POINT YOU KNOW AH
HE THREATENED TO BEAT HIM UP IN A VERY DRAMATIC FASHION
AND I HAD A GREAT ONE
UM
YEAH AND AH SHE CALLS HERSELF OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE
I HAD THAT SAME FEELING NOW
I DECIDED TO GO ONLINE TO TALK TO ONE OF MY INTERNET FRIENDS
AH HE HAS BEEN EMOTIONALLY ABUSED NEVER PHYSICALLY ABUSED
YOU KNOW
LET'S READ A COUPLE OF SURVEYS
I AM SO HAPPY I DECIDED TO GO TO A SUPPORT GROUP
AND ANOTHER TOLD ME
THAT HAD TO DO WITH SOMETHING THIRTY YEARS AGO AND THINGS AT WORK AND
HOWEVER EARLONNE
SHE WRITES IT WAS CHRISTMASTIME AND I WAS ABOUT FIVE YEARS OLD
FUCKING LAY INTO IT LAY INTO SOME AH
FROM THE MUSICAL ANNIE
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO BUSY SURVIVING ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR PARTNER
BUT JOHN SPENT HOURS IN THE LAB ON HIS OWN OUTSIDE OF CLASS
BUT I WASN'T GONNA THROW THE FIRST PUNCH CAUSE I WAS FRIGHTENED
AND THERE'S A DEBATE AMONGST PEOPLE INSIDE
I'LL CUT A BITCH
I SAID NO I WANT HIM TO APOLOGIZE
AND YOU JUST BRUSH YOUR EYELIDS
WILL IT EVER
THIS WAS IN PART FOR RELIGIOUS REASONS UNTIL I WAS EX-COMMUNICATED DUE TO MY SEXUALITY
AND I'M SORRY THAT I DON'T
THAT WAS FUN THANK YOU
YOU KNOW ARE MURDERS WORTH REHABILITATING
IT WAS NOT QUITE A BABY SQUIRREL AND NOT QUITE FULL GROWN MY MOTHER RESCUED IT WHEN THE CAT DROPPED IT FROM HIS MOUTH
FOR MONTHS LEADING UP TO THE WALK WE WOULD SIT IN THE DINING HALLS AND ADVERTISE THE WALK
THERE'S ANY SPECIFIC KIND OF CHUNKS THAT YOU CAN THINK TO ASK BUT I THINK THAT'S SORT OF THE BROAD
ABOUT HER CODEPENDENCY MY PARENTS HAVE INVOLVED ME SO DEEPLY IN THEIR PROBLEMS AND LIFE TROUBLES THAT MY MERE HAPPINESS HANGS ON THE BALANCE OF HOW THEIR DAY IS GOING
EARLONNE
OR THEIR OWN THOUGHTS THEY MIGHT NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE
THAT IS BEAUTIFUL
BOY THAT'S BEAUTIFUL THOSE ARE THE MOMENTS THAT
AND PASSED THE PHONE TO MY DAD
AND IT'S FUNNY HOW MY FIRST INSTINCT IS TO LIKE DO MORE OCEAN SWIMMING
UM
SORRY LIKE A LITTLE DOG YEAH I'M SORRY
INITIALLY MY HUSBAND AND I PLANNED TO GET OVER IT TO JUST LOOK PAST IT FOR THE SAKE OF HIS WIFE HIS CHILDREN AND PARENTS AND SISTERS
I ASK RETA IF SHE'LL MEET WITH ME
BECAUSE NO ONE IN HER FAMILY TALKS TO HER ANYMORE I'M NOT ASHAMED TO ADMIT THAT A WEIGHT SEEMED TO LIFT FROM MY SHOULDERS THINKING ABOUT HER AS A FAILED HUMAN BEING
THEN BUCCI STARTED GETTING CREATIVE I'M PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH GOOD HYGIENE
THAT'S A LOSS
YOU GUYS HAVE NEVER PLAYED CIVILIZATION
SO THEN I DID THAT FOR ANOTHER THREE YEARS
FIX SOCIETY
ACCIDENTALLY PUT TWO SINCES IN THERE
MY FAMILY WAS NEVER REALLY THAT BAD TO ME BUT THEY JUST FEEL LIKE THIS NEGATIVE PRESENCE THAT I CAN'T STAND TO HAVE HANGING OVER ME THEY ARE A NEGATIVE PRESENCE
ANYWAY
THE PHYSICAL ABUSE HE WRITES I DON'T REALLY COUNT THE PHYSICAL ABUSE MY DAD HIT ME ONCE WHEN I WAS YOUNG IT DIDN'T HURT THOUGH AND HE FELT IMMEDIATE GUILT
SINCE SHE WAS A LITTLE OLDER
IT REALLY MADE ME THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF PERSON I WANTED TO BE

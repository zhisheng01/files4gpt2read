I NEVER BECAME A CROSS-DRESSER BUT I DID LIKE IT SUBMITTING TO HER FETISHES
I WENT INTO A SHELL I WENT INTO A
THAT MAN KEPT THAT BOAT UP
WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG MY BIOLOGICAL FATHER WAS VERY EMOTIONALLY ABUSIVE HE WOULD YELL AT ME IF I WAS SCARED HAPPY SAD SICK AND GOD FORBID I EVER SHOW ANY ANGER
AND ANY OF THESE APPLY TO YOU
YOU KNOW
TO MAKE LOVE
I GREW UP VERY FAR AWAY FROM THERE
DARKEST SECRETS ONCE I FONDLED MY YOUNGER BROTHER'S EARS BY PLACING MY LIPS ON THEM FROM BEHIND TO THIS DAY I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID THIS AS OPPOSED TO DOING SOMETHING MORE INVASIVE
MY DAUGHTERS ARE THE DELIGHT OF MY LIFE BUT LET'S FACE IT BABIES SUCK
SO I HAD TO GO TO A MENTAL HOSPITAL WHICH WAS
DISCONNECTION FROM MY BODY WHICH BEGAN TO GO THROUGH CHANGES I DIDN'T LIKE AND WASN'T PREPARED FOR
TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT IT AND RIDE IT OUT
I FEEL LIKE I'M NEEDY AND ANNOYING
LIKE HE SAYS THEY DID WITH HIS LAWNMOWER AND SOME OTHER THINGS THE BUSES AND TRAILER DON'T RUN SO HE'S HIRED A CREW OF GUYS WITH BIG TRUCKS TO TOW THEM OUT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK LULULEMON PANTS ARE ANYWAYS
UM ANYONE ELSE WAS YOU KNOW
BUT OTHERWISE OK
INSIDE I WAS A FIVE-YEAR-OLD LITTLE BOY ASKING FOR MOMMY'S APPROVAL AND UM
OBSESSIVE HYPOCHONDRIA INSPIRED BY THE STRANGE SYMPTOMS THE RESULTING HORMONAL IMBALANCE CAUSED AND CONTINUES TO CAUSE LIKE DIZZINESS MIGRAINES NAUSEA
AND THE DARKNESS AND MY PARENTS CAME FROM HUNGARY
YOU KNOW MOST OF US WHO TRY SOMETHING NEW FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU KNOW WE USUALLY STRUGGLE YOU KNOW
SO WHAT
YOU KNOW
YOU ARE AWESOME
AN APOLOGY
WHO NEVER MENTIONED ANYTHING ABOUT MY EMOTIONAL OUTBURST MY DAD GOT ON THE PHONE HE TALKED ABOUT HIS CAR AND WHATEVER MY DAD TALKS ABOUT AND THEN SAID HEY
TYSON ENDED UP WITH AN ASSIST AND SEVENTEEN MINUTES IN PENALTIES THAT NIGHT
HAS CLIMBED THE RANKS
I TOOK A BUNCH OF BENADRYL
NO I WOULD JUST GET BEAT
AFTER WORKING FULL-TIME FOR SIX YEARS IN A CAREER PATH I DON'T ENJOY I'M FINALLY GOING BACK TO UNIVERSITY
I ALLOWED MYSELF TO SOB
AND THEN I JUST REALIZED THIS THIS NAH HE'S DEAD
BECAUSE IT INCREASES THE CHANCES THAT THEY WILL SEE REALITY
REALLY
GAVE LAST RITES THESE WERE ALL THINGS I DIDN'T KNOW AND THEN THEY ASKED US TO STEP OUT ON OUR DECK
LOOK FOR A TROPHY TO POSSIBLY ARRIVE ON YOUR FRONT PORCH
RUN
THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT JUST SO I FEEL REALLY SCARED ABOUT THAT ONE
I'VE LEARNED THAT THEIR NAMES ARE RETA AND CHARLIE LAWRENCE
UM
WHEN THEY ALL LEFT I WENT TO THE TOP OF THE STAIRS WHERE SHE HAD FALLEN AND I STARTED PICKING HER TEETH OUT OF THE CARPET
OH
AGAINST GRANT FUHR
AND SO
IF YOU'RE EVER LOOKING FOR SOMETHING AH
IN THE MOMENT I FELT FOR PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE
UM
AWFUL-SOME MOMENT WE'VE EVER HAD
THERE YOU HAVE IT
AND AH
PAUL AND DEL ARE IN THEIR LATE FORTIES
THIS IS FROM THE HAPPY MOMENTS SURVEY FILLED OUT BY A WOMAN WHO CALLS HER SELF STARFORD STARLORD STARLORD SHE WRITES
WHICH IS INTERESTING ACTUALLY BECAUSE THE FIRST PARTNER CERTAINLY DIDN'T
CAUSE I WAS LIKE THE LEADING SCORER IN EXHIBITION AND
I WISH I KNEW WHO I WAS
I WOULD
WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE HERE
I'M SORRY IF THIS SEEMS ALL OVER THE PLACE I'VE NEVER SPOKEN TO ANYONE ABOUT IT
MAYBE SHE MEANS CUPID BUT OBVIOUSLY THE
AND I WENT TO GET MY FIRST PHONE THAT DAY
WE'RE GOING TO CALL HER HUSBAND PAUL
ALL THE DARK STUFF
IT'S HARD TO BLAME HIM BECAUSE HE GREW UP IN A HOUSEHOLD WITHOUT LOVE
YOU SAID YOU FOUND OUT THROUGH TYLER
HE'S NOT YOUR DAD
BUT NOT BE YOUR LIFE PARTNER ANYMORE
AFTER GETTING THROUGH WITH THE HOSPITAL I CAME HOME I WAS TAKING A NEW PAIN KILLER THAT MADE ME VERY CONSTIPATED
WE ARRANGED A NEW APPOINTMENT IN A WEEK AND I WAS ON MY WAY TO FACE THE WORLD BY THE WAY I WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO THAT IF YOU WERE BEING MUGGED OR ROBBED OR RAPED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT YES
I CAN'T THINK OF A TIME THAT I FELT MORE INTENSELY CARED FOR AND INSTANTLY HOPEFUL THAN IN THAT MOMENT
IF YOU'VE BEEN IN A NEGLECTED
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IT IS THAT GETS US OFF OR WHERE IT COMES FROM THOUGH I'M ENDLESSLY FASCINATED BY IT
I'M ONLY SLIGHTLY OVERWEIGHT SO I'M NOT SURE WHY THEY DO THAT TO ME
I JUST DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THAT WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR OUR FAMILY FOR MY SON
LIKE I HAD DELUDED MYSELF BY THE STUFF THAT I HAD MADE PREVIOUSLY THAT I THOUGHT WAS GOOD
BUT I HAD NO IDEA THE LEVEL OF HEALING I COULD GAIN FROM ONE NIGHT OF BEING VULNERABLE WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE I HAD NO CONNECTION WITH UNTIL THAT VERY MOMENT
SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO SEND A BURRITO
BESIDES FOR THE FILM IT'S FOR SOME OF THE WORK WE DO NOW WITH YOUNG GIRLS WE TEACH EMPOWERMENT WORKSHOPS AND BOXING TO YOUNG GIRLS
THEY TAKE HIM AWAY AND I REMEMBER BEFORE THEY DID I REMEMBER WE COVERED HIM UP AND MY BROTHER DEREK JUST COLLAPSED ON HIM AND JUST I MEAN LET OUT THIS WAIL AND JUST WAS LIKE WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO US WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO US AND INSIDE ME I KNEW
LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER THE COUSINS GAINED CONTROL OF THE MCLEMORE PROPERTY
BY THE WAY MY SUICIDAL EPISODE WAS CAUSED BY A REALLY BAD REACTION TO A NEW MEDICATION I WAS ON
I WAS SAD FOR MYSELF I WAS SAD FOR OUR PARTNERSHIP
FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THAT AND IF YOU'D LIKE MORE INFORMATION UM
SHE WRITES I CONSTANTLY NEED ATTENTION IN MY RELATIONSHIP MY SUPPORTIVE AND LOVING BOYFRIEND IS SO GOOD TO ME
YOU HAVE TO GET STRIP SEARCHED COUGH
THAT'S THE PAIN OF IT IS I GO
AND EVERY
PEOPLE MAKING CHEWING NOISES ABSOLUTELY MAKE RAGE AND HATE WELL UP INSIDE OF ME
EMAIL ME
MY WIFE AND I DON'T OFTEN EAT TOGETHER AND IF WE DO THERE HAS TO BE SOME NOISE TV RADIO ETC
WEST AFRICA
YOU KNOW IT'S A MIRACLE THAT I CAN SIT IN A CHAIR FOR HOURS ON END WITHOUT
FORM YOUR OWN THOUGHTS FOR ONCE
SHE PAID THE FIRST ONE
WE'VE ALREADY MOVED PAST EACH OTHER
THIS IS A HAPPY MOMENT FILLED OUT BY PEOPLE TELL ME I'M STRONG
THESE SURVEYS TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
YOU KNOW WE'LL WALK LIKE TWENTY KILOMETRES A DAY
HIT MY HEAD AGAINST ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN MY WAY

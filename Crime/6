I'M SOFT AS COTTON
YOU GET UP ON THE STAIRS OF THE PLANE AND YOU GET UP
HERBERT
YEAH HE OVERDOSED
I GET IT THAT SHIT STICKS WITH US
AH CLASS FROM ONE OF THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS
AND I WOULD SOMETIMES PUT GEL IN MY HAIR WHICH
BUT I WANTED TO READ THAT BECAUSE
THERE WASN'T TIME TO GO RECORD TOMORROW
BECAUSE I WAS FILLED WITH SO MUCH PANIC AND GUILT THAT I WAS ABOUT TO BURST INTO TEARS
SO YOU KNOW BUT THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO YOU KNOW WORK ON
BUT HE SAID THAT THE CRIME THAT SENT HIM TO PRISON THE FIRST TIME
MONTHS
IT WOULD BE I HATE YOU I HATE THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO LOVE YOU ONLY BECAUSE WE SHARE SOME DNA I HATE HOW YOU TREATED ME
TRIP
I SAW THAT IN HIM AND THAT'S PART OF WHY I REACHED OUT TO HIM JOHN B MCLEMORE'S EDUCATION IS THE SOURCE OF SOME GOSSIP IN WOODSTOCK
SADLY JUST NOT IN YOUR HOME AND
IT'S ALSO ABOUT MUSIC AS THERAPY AND EAR HUSTLERS MIGHT RECOGNIZE THE GUY TALKING
AND EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T SURE OF THE RIGHT THING TO DO
AND THEN YOU SEE YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT RUN OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE PROBABLY MORE SICK THAN US AS VICTIMS ARE
THIS STORY PICKS UP WITH HIM TALKING ABOUT HIS SISTER COMING TO VISIT HIM IN PRISON
AND DIDN'T REPORT THE OTHER
WHY
CATHARTIC
THAT SINCE HE PROPOSED
ABOUT LIVING WITH AN ABUSER
THAT'S KIND OF THOSE TWO I JUST
ALMOST DRAGGED HIM INTO A BATHROOM AFTER A FUNERAL TWO YEARS AGO IT'S DISGUSTING
SHE'S GROWN UP NOW AND BETTER BUT I STRUGGLE TRYING TO FORGIVE HER AND MY DAD I LOVE THEM SO MUCH
FAILURE
IF I WANTED TO IS LIKE A DRUG
SAY THAT YOU'RE FEELING ALONE
AND I WAS GO MY BROTHERS WERE ALREADY IN BED AND I'M WALKING DOWN THE HALLWAY TO GO TO BED
COMFORTED AS MANY PEOPLE AS THAT EPISODE DID BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO VIEW
THIS IS AN AWFULSOME MOMENT FILLED OUT BY I'M DEPRESSED HI DEPRESSED I'M DAD
HE ON HIS WAY BACK TO THE PLACE HE WAS STAYING
IT'S KIND OF NICE
I REMEMBER DISTINCTLY ONE REALLY FUCKED-UP COPING MECHANISM I HAD WAS TO SIT ON THE FLOOR ON MY KNEES AND JUST LIKE BASH MY FOREHEAD INTO THE GROUND UNTIL LIKE MY HEAD WAS NUMB
AND I TOLD HER TO FUCK OFF AND LEFT HER HOUSE FOR THE LAST TIME
THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOME GOOD SOLID ADVICE TO ME
IT'S ALL ABOUT TOOLS MAN
IT DOES TAKE WORK
CONFLICT AVOIDANCE AND PASSIVE AGGRESSION
SORT OF
FILLED OUT BY A WOMAN WHO CALLS HERSELF RIGORI GASPUTIN
I'VE SAID IT BEFORE I'LL SAY IT AGAIN NOBODY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM WHEN THEY ARE DRUNK OR PASSED OUT
BUT I WONDER
I CRAVED THAT FEELING
WHEN I WAS A KID
SO IF YOU WANNA CHECK OUT NATUREBOX WHICH I HIGHLY RECOMMEND
THAT'S WHAT TAKE ME OUT MEANS RIGHT
MY PERFECTIONISM GRIPS ME LIKE A VICE I'M FROZEN UNTIL SOMEONE TELLS ME I'M DOING OK
CHRISTIANA
WOW
THERE'S MORE TO THE STORY BUT PERHAPS BEST SAVED FOR ANOTHER SURVEY OR SOMETHING
IF IF CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES
WERE THERE ANY OTHER SPOTS LIKE OUTSIDE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
I LEARNED THAT NONE OF THEM WERE AT JOHN'S FUNERAL BECAUSE NONE OF THEM WERE CONTACTED IN TIME
ONE WHO'S THROUGH IT
WAS THAT WORTH IT
BECAUSE YOU ARE A FUCKING AWESOME MOM
I WOULD WANT HIM TO GET A DICTIONARY AND LOOK UP THE WORDS BITTER ENTITLED AND RESENTFUL AND TELL HIM THAT IF HE CAN LET GO IT'S POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO BE HAPPY
OH
I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO
NOBODY WANT TO CELL WITH THEM
THEY HAVE HOPE
AND I GUESS I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH JUST EPISODES NUMBER THREE WITH THIS EAR HUSTLE BECAUSE LOOKING OUT WHICH WAS PETS IN PRISON WASN'T MY FAVORITE
UM AND
HE'S READING SOMETHING HE WROTE ABOUT THE INSANITY OF GETTING PROCESSED INTO PRISON
WELL THERE'S A LOT OF GUYS IN HERE WHO CUT HAIR BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO LOOK SHARP
NEURO-FUNCTION IS THAT A WORD NEURO-FUNCTION
BUT IN OFTEN WITHIN EARSHOT OF THE GUARDS AND PRISONERS
AND SHE USED TO
SHE JUST
MAYBE I HAVEN'T BUT
AND THAT SOMETHING THAT
I'M NOT KIDDING
A GIANT CYCLOPS COMES WALKING UP
I COULD BARELY THINK
IS THAT TRAUMA SHAPES US ALL IN OUR LIVES ESPECIALLY CHILDHOOD TRAUMA
I FIND THAT THE STUFF THAT I WANNA EDIT OUT IS OFTEN THE STUFF THAT
PLEASE
YEAH
DON'T SPEAK UP
AND AH
YOU CAN'T BE YOU ANYMORE
LOVE LOVE HEARING THAT
BY THE WAY THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO'VE GONE THROUGH FAR MORE THAN I HAVE AND ARE YOU KNOW JUST AS ADJUSTED AND EVERYTHING SO
AND THEN I DIDN'T GO TO THERAPY FOR YEARS AND I WAS SEEING SOMEONE AND WE SPLIT
I WORRY WHEN I'M FEELING REALLY SENTIMENTAL THAT I'M GOING TOWARDS HYPOMANIA IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH SOMEONE WHO SHARES YOUR THOUGHTS OR EXPERIENCES
FUCKED YOU UP TODAY
HOW HARD YOU'RE BEING ON YOURSELF
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S IMMUNE TO TRAUMA YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'VE DISCOVERED IS THAT
BLOOD PRESSURE WAS TAKEN SEVERAL TIMES A DAY I MET WITH THE SHRINK AND DID NOT LIKE HIM
IT STARTS IN MY THROAT AND MOVES DOWNWARD THROUGH MY CHEST EXPANDING AS IT SPREADS OUTWARD IN A SENSATION SIMILAR TO THAT OF DRINKING ICE COLD WATER FIRST THING IN THE MORNING
YOU KNOW
I USUALLY JUST GO FOR IT AND THEN I'D SAY FIFTY PERCENT OF THE TIME I SURPRISE MYSELF AND EVEN THOUGH I WAS COMPLETELY TAXED
AH
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT RESONATES WITH WHO I AM I'M A WOMAN
THAT WAS ANOTHER BYPRODUCT OF THE CHEAP OIL ECONOMY

AND
HAPPINESS AND VICTORY AND FULFILLMENT ARE NICE THINGS THAT ALSO HAPPEN TO US
I HAD A REGULAR GIRL FOR A WHILE WHO WAS PAYING HER WAY THROUGH GRAD SCHOOL BY WORKING IN THE SEX TRADE
TO STOP BEING AFRAID
I SHOULD DO TEN TO THIRTEEN AND THIRTEEN TO FIFTEEN
MAYBE I COULD HAVE SPARED HER AND FOUGHT MY FEARS AND SELF-DOUBT BUT I DIDN'T I WORRY THAT MY LIFE WILL JUST BE AN ENDLESS CYCLE OF THIS
AMONG A HOST OF OTHER THINGS SHE GAVE ME A BATH THAT FELT REALLY SKETCHY WHEN I WAS LIKE ELEVEN OR TWELVE AND I FELT TRICKED
LAID BACK ADVENTUROUS
WELL THEY WOULDN'T NEED TO BE DEAD IN FRONT OF A BUS THEY WOULD JUST NEED TO WALK IN FRONT OF A BUS
IT USES POTASSIUM CYANIDE INSTEAD
LIKE IT JUST ERASED ALL OF IT
MY POOR HEALTH AND PANIC ATTACKS
NOTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED HAS TAKEN AWAY YOUR ABILITY TO BE KIND INTELLIGENT PROFOUND OR FUNNY
WHEN HE WAS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD ELIJAH STARTED SEEING A COUNSELOR
HE WASN'T SICK HE'D BEEN QUARANTINED BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN IN TOUCH WITH ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO TESTED POSITIVE
I'VE KNOWN A FEW OTHER PEOPLE TO FIND THAT THEY SUFFER SIMILARLY
OK WHATEVER
AND UNTIL I WROTE IT DOWN ON PAPER
I'M IN PRISON
AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO SELF-SURRENDER
I THINK WE THINK ABOUT THOSE LITTLE MOMENTS
YOU COME DOWN HERE FROM NEW YORK FOR THIS
REALLY SAW ME
AND THEN I REALIZED I'M IN MY PAJAMAS AND THEY HAVE
KEEPS ME FROM BEING ABLE TO FULLY LOVE MYSELF
AND ABOUT HER ANOREXIA
CHANGE
DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT OR NO
WHAT'S THE WORD HAVE ADMIRATION FOR MY WORK THAT YOU KNOW I ENDED UP DOING
TRUTHFUL
I KNOW I AM NOT THE IDEAL PARENT FOR HIM
YOU KNOW WHAT
THOUGH ALLEN DOESN'T SPEAK THE WORD I GUESS THAT WAS HOW LONG HOW LONG AGO
AND WILL TRY TO OVERDOSE I WANT TO BE LESS CONNECTED TO MY FAMILY BECAUSE THE SENSE OF OBLIGATION I FEEL TO THEM IS SOMETIMES OVERPOWERING AND CRUSHING
I'M NEVER GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH FRIENDS TO SATISFY ME I'M NEVER GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH LOVE TO SATISFY ME
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MADE ME REALIZE THAT I NEEDED HELP
SO I'LL FIND MYSELF LAYING DOWN
THAT WAS ME
WE DIDN'T WANT TO USE HER REAL NAME SO CURTIS CALLS HER J
I THOUGHT I DIDN'T WANT LONG HAIR NO MY MOTHER DIDN'T WANT ME TO HAVE LONG HAIR
I AM SO THANKFUL MY THERAPIST FOUND THIS GROUP FOR ME
FOR A LOT OF THESE ITEMS TYLER DOESN'T HAVE PROOF OF OWNERSHIP
I DON'T CARE NO MORE
AND WE'RE FORCED TO MOVE INTO YOUR PLACE
THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT
I DECIDED TO TAKE A RISK
THIS IS AN AWFULSOME MOMENT FILLED OUT BY TOMMATHY CONRAD
THIS SURVEY WAS FILLED OUT BY QUEEN BITCH
GREAT IDEA
I'M NOT THAT COMFORTABLE EXPRESSING MOST FEELINGS BUT I'M GETTING CLOSER
AND HAVING TO SAY THIS WAS A BIG DEAL TO ME
BUT YOU GET ONE HOUR EXERCISE OUT IN THAT YARD A DAY AND THERE'S A CAMERA IN THE CELL
ANYBODY LISTENING
AND THAT BECAME MY WHOLE THING IS THAT I'M NOT GOING TO SHAKE AND CRY
ABOUT HER CO-DEPENDENCY I CAN ONLY OPEN UP TO MY SISTER BUT NOT WITHOUT BURDENING HER AND PUSHING HER AWAY
BUT YOU KNOW SLOWLY BUT SURELY YOU KNOW
NEW YORK IS THANKFULLY DOING OKAY
I'VE DONE BEEN UP UNDER THERE
IN PARTICULAR THE SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN
I'D RATHER NOT SAY
UM
AND IS MANAGING GRANDFATHER TO MY SISTER'S KIDS SO I NEVER KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT HIM I JUST KNOW HE RESENTED ME AND MY SISTERS DEEPLY FOR A VERY LONG TIME
CAN DEFINITELY DO IT
ABOUT HER DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE MAKES IT IN PRISON HE'S HAD A HARD TIME AND WE'RE GONNA HEAR ABOUT THAT
BUT I HAVE TO BE THE PERFECT CHILD THE ONE THAT DOESN'T CAUSE TROUBLE
ON THAT DAY I FELT MORE GROWN THAN MY MOTHER I FELT STRONG
LADIES WOULD DO IT TIL THEIR BONNETS FELL OFF
HE TOLD ME HE HADN'T HAD A DRINK IN X DAYS HADN'T DONE DRUGS IN X DAYS
IS WHAT THEY SAY
I THINK THAT OTHER THINGS MAY HAVE HAPPENED BETWEEN MY FATHER AND I BUT I WAS SO YOUNG THAT I'M JUST NOT SURE I FEEL LIKE I MAY HAVE BLOCKED OUT MEMORIES FROM THAT TIME IN MY LIFE
THEY SAID IT WAS A GANG FIGHT
I JUST
MAN I WANT WHAT SHE HAS
AND YOU'RE NOT A BIG BABY
HE'S BEEN EMOTIONALLY ABUSED
THAT IS
SO WITH THAT
AND MY FIRST QUESTION TO HIM WAS BOYS OR GIRLS
THIS IS A WOMAN WE'RE CALLING DEL
THEN I FEEL THAT WAY
I TOLD HIM WHAT WAS SAID AND I'LL NEVER FORGET JOEL'S FACE HE'S SUCH A SOLID GUY HE SAID DO YOU WANT ME TO HAVE TYSON TAKE HIS GEAR OFF
I SPEAK TO THE BADDEST DUDES ON THE PLANET
AND SHE DIDN'T DRIVE AND MY MOTHER HAS KNOWN MY GRANDMOTHER BEFORE WE WERE EVEN BORN SHE KNOWS SHE DOESN'T DRIVE
AND IN THAT LIST OF GRADUATING STUDENTS WAS MY DAUGHTER'S NAME
WHERE MY ABUSER WOULD ACT AND TALK TO ME AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED
AND HER NAME IS
AND WE ARE SENDING IT YOUR WAY MYSELF AND ALL THE PEOPLE ON THE FORUM WHO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL
MANY TRAVELS I HAVE HAD
I LET THEM DO IT
I IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO A SEIZURE THEN MY BODY WENT COLD AND STILL
AND I COULDN'T THINK OF ONE
IT'S A BATTLE
MEANING TO HE AND HIS WIFE SO MY QUESTION
THIS IS
I AM
HE TOLD ME HE HADN'T HAD A DRINK IN X DAYS
OR AS YOU KNOW
YEAH I WAS I WAS SO CONFUSED
I JUST REMEMBER THINKING TO MYSELF YOU'VE BEEN STARING AT THE LIGHT BULB FOR FORTY-FIVE MINUTES WHAT ARE YOU

EVER BEEN THE VICTIM OF
WE'RE LIKE THE BEST AT IT IN THE WORLD AND EVENTUALLY THOSE ENABLERS GET FED UP AND AND AH
I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE IT TO TOMORROW NOT KNOWING HOW I'M GOING TO HANDLE IT AT ALL DO YOU AT LEAST WAIT UNTIL YOUR HAIR IS IN CURLERS SO IT'S MORE STEREOTYPICAL
GOODBYE TO CIVIL LIBERTIES AND MINORITY RIGHTS ALSO
LOTS OF WEIRD PUBLIC HUMILIATION LIKE SHE'D GET SO UPSET WITH ME LIKE
THE REASON I WANTED TO READ THIS ONE
UM
I GET IT I PLAYED CIVILIZATION
JUST ON A LOGISTICAL LEVEL
HOW CAN PEOPLE SEE THE MOVIE
THAT IT WASN'T THAT BAD
BECAUSE HE NEVER RAPED OR MOLESTED ANYBODY EVER AGAIN
A HIGH FROM IT OR IS IT IS IT NOT LIKE THAT
AFTER I GOT OUT I FINALLY TOLD MY FAMILY
WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT FOR THEM BECAUSE I THEN I THINK IT HELPS SOOTHE SOME OF THE SHAME THAT THEY FEEL FROM THEIR OUTBURSTS
PLEASE DON'T TELL THIS TO YOUR KIDS
AND I'M LIKE DAD IT'S THIS LEFT
FAYE SAYS MOST OF THE PEOPLE SHE DIDN'T REACH AT FIRST BUT SHE CLAIMS SHE LEFT MESSAGES
AND HE WRITES MY OLD MAN HAD INTIMIDATED ME FOR YEARS AN ARDENT PERFECTIONIST WHO DEMEANED MY EMOTIONS AND TAUGHT ME QUOTE LESSONS IN HOW BEST TO MANIPULATE OTHERS WHILE I WAS A YOUNG BOY
HELLO
A FEW OF THEM MAY BECOME COHESIVE SOCIETIES SAYS JOHN
SUCKING IT UP AND GOING TO PERFORM
AND I DON'T THINK I FEEL ANYTHING FOR ANYONE
YOU'RE GETTING WARM
THOSE YOURS
YOU DESERVE TO BE HEARD YOU DESERVE TO BE FELT
I'M GOING TO
WELL
I KNEW I WAS NOT WANTED
AFTER COBRA RAN OUT I COULDN'T AFFORD TO PAY FOR IT OUT OF POCKET
SO WE CERTAINLY HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY WE CERTAINLY ARE NOT SCARED TO LET YOU KNOW
THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT KEEPING THE HEART MONITOR ON AS I MIGHT STRANGLE MYSELF WITH IT
EXACTLY HE WANTED ME TO HAVE TO RELY ON HIM FOR ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING IN
JUST SO
THIS IS A HAPPY MOMENT
THAT IS
BY SATURDAY
I REALLY I BLAME MY BROTHER BECAUSE HAD HE NOT DONE THAT TO ME
AND I WANTED TO FOLLOW THAT UP WITH AN EMAIL I GOT FROM
SHE SAID YOU ARE A GOOD MAN
THAT IS BEAUTIFUL
I JUST KEEP GETTING UP EVERY MORNING
YOU KNOW BECAUSE
GO ANYWHERE
SHOULD I KILL MYSELF
THESE GUYS IN PRISON SEE ME AS A TOUGH GUY
YOU CAN ALSO SUPPORT THE SHOW BY UM
AND HER BRILLIANT TECHNIQUE
MY HAIR IS FLAT NATURALLY
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED TO THOSE YOUNG KIDS
UM
I NEVER FELT MORE FREE
WHO THAT IS THE FIRST PHONE CALL SHE FIRST AND ONLY PHONE CALL SHE EVER MADE TO ME IN MY LIFE
DARKEST SECRETS I'VE HAD SOME ADDICTIONS SERIOUS ADDICTIONS IN THE PAST EVERYONE KNOWS I'M CLEAN NOW
IT'S
HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT
BUT THAT TAKES CONFIDENCE AND CONFIDENCE TAKES
BEING MARGINALIZED LIKE THAT AND THAT JOKES LIKE THAT DO HAVE AN EFFECT AND THEY DO LEAD TO SUICIDES
MADE INSIDE DARWIN CORRECTIONAL CENTRE ON THE NORTHERN TIP OF AUSTRALIA
SHE WAS WAITING FOR ME TO TAKE OVER
YOU KNOW SPEAKING TO
AND I HOPE THAT YOU'LL STAY WITH US
YOU KNOW
THAT'S THE HARDEST AND SCARIEST PART
THAT I WALKED THE TEN MILES HOME AND DIDN'T EVEN FEEL TIRED OR SORE AFTERWARDS
I'M NOT SURE ANYTHING ELSE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN ME OUT OF THAT UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIP
ANY POSITIVE EXPERIENCES WITH THE ABUSERS MY STEPFATHER WAS THE FULL FATHER OF MY YOUNGER BROTHER AND WAS SLASH IS A VERY GOOD FATHER TO HIM AND IS MANAGING
AND SHE TELLS ME MAN WHY DON'T YOU WRITE A SONG THAT WHEN I HEAR IT
WE'VE GOT WOMEN'S SIZES TOO
A SEASON OR SOMETHING
SEEING HER FACE AND WHAT SHE WAS DOING SOOTHED ME AND CALMED ME DOWN
THIS IS AN AWFUL-SOME MOMENT
YOU KNOW
AND AS MUCH AS I WAS STILL DOING THE BEHAVIOR MY CONSCIOUSNESS WAS CHANGING
UM
THIS IS AN AWFUL-SOME MOMENT FILLED OUT BY
I GREW UP IN CALIFORNIA SO THE NOVELTY OF WATER COMING FROM THE SKY HASN'T WORN OFF YET
I JUST TELL PEOPLE
FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE
WE DANCED AND DANCED HARD
DEAL
THE SCHOOL I PICKED JUST GOT IS THE EPICENTER OF THE EARTHQUAKE
WELL NEXT THING I KNOW OUR HOUSE WAS SOLD AND SHE HAS VANISHED
AS A REFEREE YOU GET A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SHIT
YOU KNOW WHY I BECAME AN ALCOHOLIC WHY I BECAME AN ADDICT WHY I GAMBLED WHY I ATE TOO MUCH WHY I HAD TOO MANY RELATIONSHIPS YOU KNOW ETC ETC
IT WAS ONE OF OUR MOST INTIMATE AND LOVING MOMENTS WE EVER HAD
AFTER HE WAS GONE MY STEPFATHER DIDN'T SPEAK TO ME FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS THEY ARE STILL TOGETHER AND WE HAVE MENDED OUR RELATIONSHIP BUT I AM STILL VERY NERVOUS AROUND HIM AND MY BROTHER DISLIKES ME BECAUSE HE DOESN'T REMEMBER THE ABUSE I SUFFERED
SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO ALL OF A SUDDEN FIND YOURSELF IN A COMPLETELY UNKNOWN WORLD
NO TATTOOS AH I DON'T THINK I LOOK LIKE THE TYPICAL CONVICT
SHE STARTED INTRODUCING ME TO ALL THESE
NEVER TO THE POINT OF PHYSICAL INJURY BUT I DO GRAB HIM ROUGHLY
DAD DIES
YOU KNOW
TALKING
STANDING IN THE RAIN
I TOLD HIM WE HAD A LITTLE PROBLEM
AND AH AND MY PARENTS KNEW WHAT I WANTED TO DO FROM FROM DAY ONE SO THEY DIDN'T STAND IN MY WAY AND
BAD THERAPISTS AND SHAME THEM
BUT FROM THE INSIDE
ANY POSITIVE EXPERIENCES WITH THE ABUSERS THERE ARE SO MANY

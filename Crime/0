ONCE THE GAME STARTS LIKE THE THE SAN QUENTIN ENVIRONMENT KIND OF FADES AWAY
NO
NO ANSWER
ON THE DAY OF THE PARADE
PAINFUL
THE WORST CRIMINAL IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
IN THAT MOMENT
AND I THINK WE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE ALL ENJOYED A VIDEO OF THAT AS WELL
FILLED ME WITH JOY I CAN'T EVEN DESCRIBE
WHAT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IS HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT AND THAT YOU TALK TO SOMEBODY SAFE ABOUT IT
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO
BEFORE THE COUSINS HAD A CHANCE TO SELL IT
THAT
I GOT REALLY DRUNK ON WAY TOO MUCH WHISKEY AND PUNCHED MYSELF FOR HOURS UNTIL HE GOT HOME AND HELD ME DOWN
THIS IS FROM THE HAPPY MOMENTS SURVEY
I WOULD HAVE IMAGINED THAT HE WAS RAISED IN A SAFE AND NURTURING ENVIRONMENT
UNDERNEATH THE SIGN REMINDING HIM THAT HE'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE ON EARTH
EXCELLENT
AND WHAT I WAS TOLD
UM
IS WHAT WE CALL THE PROVERBIAL ROCK BOTTOM
MELT SOME FACES
HE'D MENTIONED HAVING PULLED IT OUT OF THE BANK
SEVEN HOURS LAST NIGHT
I'VE BEEN TOLD A SEX OFFENDER'S BIGGEST WEAPON IS SECRECY
SO LET'S LET'S BACK UP THEN TO YOU'RE STARTING TO GET GOOD AT HOCKEY
I ALSO WORKED WITH A NEUROSCIENTIST
YOU KNOW AND THAT WE'RE DOING SOMETHING TOGETHER
SO I THINK I'M GOING TO PUT MY FOOT DOWN AND FINALLY ASK FOR THAT DIVORCE AFTER CHRISTMAS
THE SLIGHTEST GESTURE OF LOVE AND COMPASSION
WHO ABUSED A GIRL
I'M AN ALIEN FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY
I FEEL FINE SHARING THIS BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I WOULD TELL PEOPLE IN MY LIFE
SOMEONE SHE LOVED
MY ANXIETY HAS ME CONSTANTLY QUESTIONING WHETHER OR NOT WHAT SOMEONE SAID TO ME WAS BECAUSE OF MY RACE
HOW DID SOMEBODY SAY IT ONE TIME
YOU KNOW
WHILE
OK SO HERE'S A QUESTION
WHICH YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS WAS ATTACHED TO THE FOLLOWING INFORMATIONS
THROUGH THAT FIRST TIME
I LAID BACK DOWN IN MY BED AND SOBBED HARDER THAN I REMEMBER SOBBING IN A LONG TIME
WHERE SOMEONE'S HUSBAND BECAME A WOMAN AND WOUND UP IN JAIL BECAUSE HE HAD TO STEAL TO PAY FOR THE OPERATION
SHE WAS ALWAYS EMOTIONALLY SHUT DOWN
I DON'T KNOW I JUST HAVE THE FEELING WHEN WE GO DEEPER INTO OURSELVES
SO AS I SAID
IS THIS POSSIBLY TRUE
YOU KNOW BUT THE PAST OF BEING YOU KNOW
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER CALLING YOU KNOW IT WAS THE NEXT BEST THING
HOW DOES A SHADOW LIVE
CAN EMBRACE THAT COCKSUCKER
SO
THERE'S A SWATH OF HUMAN
THE PLACE THAT I HAVE DIFFICULTY HAVING COMPASSION FOR PEOPLE IS WHEN THEY HAVE AN ISSUE THAT THEY KNOW IS DESTRUCTIVE ESPECIALLY TO OTHER PEOPLE
AND PROBABLY I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO CHURCH FOR THIS DAMN FUNERAL MAYBE NOT LET IT GO JUST YET
FEAR MANIFESTING AS AGGRESSION
YOU KNOW I'M MAKING IT THROUGH THIS HOUR
SEE MY MOM AND DAD
AND WHAT THEY'VE TAUGHT ME IS THEY'VE TAUGHT ME COMPASSION
OLDER MALE ROLE MODEL YOU KNOW
THAT HADN'T HAPPENED TO ME
THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH TOGETHER
SO GOD BLESS YOU IF YOU CAN GET THROUGH THAT A CHILDHOOD IN ADOLESCENCE
KRISTY
THIS IS THE FIRST MAJOR EMOTIONAL CRISIS I'VE FACED SINCE I STOPPED SEEING MY THERAPIST AND SINCE I DECIDED THAT MY FIRST MAJOR DEPRESSIVE EPISODE WAS OVER
MY FATHER WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD I WAS MORE AFRAID OF THAN MY MOTHER I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT MY FATHER AND HE SHOWED NO SIDE OF HIMSELF THAT WASN'T AGGRESSIVE AND SNIDE TO ME THE MAN WAS A MYSTERY
YOU KNOW THAT WAS PART OF MY RECOVERY
I'M ABLE TO TYPE THIS OUT WITHOUT HAVING A PANIC ATTACK THANKS TO THERAPY
UM
WHEN TYSON GOT TO US HIS LIP WAS ACTUALLY QUIVERING
YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO I'VE BECOME REALLY PROUD OF OVER THE LAST YOU KNOW PROBABLY
NOW I KNOW THE TRUTH
HOW COULD YOU
TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF BEING HURT
HE'S GOT THIS GREAT BIG HORNED HEAD KIND OF LIKE A UNICORN'S HORN EXCEPT IT'S TILTED AND LIKE IT'S LIKE BROKEN AT THE END AND HE SAYS I'M ERUDITUS
I'VE TAKEN ON SOME VERY ADULT RESPONSIBILITIES
YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY
I KNOW YOU LIKE THE PODCAST BUT SOMETIMES I FORGET THAT THAT MEANS YOU ALSO CARE ABOUT ME PERSONALLY
THERE'S GOTTA BE A THIRD THING
SHE SHOWED PHOTOS OF US HANGING OUT ALONG WITH ME AT TWO OF HER BIRTHDAY PARTIES
YOUR FUTURE'S FUCKED
YEAH THAT'S A SCARY ONE YEAH BUT YOURS ISN'T
AND I WANTED TO TALK TO SOMEONE ELSE AT SAN QUENTIN ABOUT THIS WHO DOESN'T IDENTIFY AS MALE AH YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LADY JAE
AND NOW SHE'S BEEN A BOXER SHE'S FORTY SIX AND SHE'S THE OLDEST
AND SO J WENT DOWN TO THE PIZZA PLACE AND UM
OF LOOP OR HOLE OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT
I'M GONNA NAME IT THE WAY THAT I NAMED IT FOR OUR SEVEN-YEAR-OLD
MANIPULATE
YOU'RE FEELING YOUR FEELINGS AND THEY MATTER
I WISH THAT I COULD DRINK NORMALLY THE HOLIDAYS MAKE IT SO MUCH HARDER TO NOT THINK ABOUT BOOZE
MAMA AS HE CALLS HER
MY DAD DID A GOOD JOB ON PAPER IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAD A GOOD MOTHER
HOW DO YOU FEEL AFTER WRITING THESE THINGS DOWN
ALL OF MY PAIN WAS FLOODING OUT AND EVEN THOUGH I WAS BLUBBERING LIKE A BABY I COULD NOT STOP TALKING
RIGHT
COOPID STUNT
PODCAST IF YOU'RE IN THE L A AREA
THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN TO TAKE MY MEDS
ALL DAY
YOU ARE LOOKING AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR AND THAT'S WHY YOU'VE BEEN TRIGGERED AND THAT'S WHY YOU GET NEGATIVE EMOTIONS AND NEGATIVE FEELINGS FROM

ALTHOUGH HE CONTINUED TO ABUSE ME AFTER THAT NIGHT I NEVER AGAIN SAW HIM AS AN INDOMITABLE FORCE
HE BACKED DOWN
ONE OF MY COWORKERS FROM ACROSS THE WORKSTATION LOOKED AT ME
THAT IS AS FAR AS JOHN'S SUICIDE
YOU KNOW I HAD THREE AMAZING FATHERS WHO BECAME MY COACHES AND BECAME MY MENTORS THEY COACHED ME FOR NINE YEARS AND UM YOU KNOW THIRTEEN SETS OF PARENTS IN RUSSELL MANITOBA THAT YOU KNOW LOOKED AFTER ME AND
THANK YOU FOR THAT
THEY SHOCKED MY HEART BACK AND HERE I AM
REAMED INTO THE HOUSE I THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS WRONG AT A NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE AND THEY WERE TRYING TO GO THROUGH MY HOUSE TO GET TO THE NEIGHBORS AND IT TURNS OUT THEY HAD A WARRANT FOR MY HOUSE
WELL
AND THAT I WISH I COULD HAVE HELPED HER GET BETTER
BEING A WOMAN AND LIKE
FEAR MANIFESTING AS FEAR
THIS IS FROM THE SHAME AND SECRETS SURVEY FILLED OUT BY A GUY WHO CALLS HIMSELF MCDUCK
VERY FIRST NIGHT
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK AS I READ THAT
AND THERAPY AND SUPPORT GROUPS HELP US LEARN A NEW SCRIPT BECAUSE WE GET TO
NOBODY QUESTIONS YOU
A
IT'S THIS LEFT
PASS UP THAT ONE
IT'S MORE LIKE A WAITING ROOM THAT DOESN'T SUCK
THIS IS A HAPPY MOMENT FILLED OUT BY VIXEN AND SHE WRITES AFTER MY FAMILY DIED MY FRIENDS WANTED ME TO FEEL LIKE I WAS A PART OF THEIR OWN FAMILY
THE FUNNY THING IS I HAD I HAD
IT'S ONLY EIGHT BUCKS A MONTH AND YOU GET A FREE DOMAIN IF YOU BUY SQUARE SPACE FOR THE YEAR
THAT IS DEEP
I THINK HE
I'M LIKE WHAT'S A DYKE
THAT NIGHT CHANGED MY LIFE
BECOMING COMFORTABLE WITH ALL THE
BILL MAIER
THIS IS FILLED OUT BY A WOMAN WHO CALLS HERSELF BARFALA
SO I WAS SO GROSSED OUT BY THAT AND I HAD SO MUCH GUILT AROUND SEXUALITY UNTIL I GOT MARRIED
WE ALL DO
AND THEY'RE AGENDER
AND SO I EXUDE THAT YOU KNOW IN MY ENERGY IN THE WAY THAT PEOPLE APPROACH ME AND
IT'S NOT WHAT I WANT TO BE
POT CAN BE REALLY
YOU ARE WORTH IT
LIKE SITTING ACROSS FROM YOU
IT'S NOT HURTING ANYONE
YOU KNOW IN AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD I WON A WORLD JUNIOR
AND IT WAS MIDNIGHT
SO
COFFEE
I THINK
AND THAT WAY I CAN JUST
HE DOESN'T LINGER ON THE SUICIDE NOTE LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO READ IT
I DON'T KNOW I GUESS WHAT I WANNA SAY IS I COULD STILL REALLY USE YOUR
LAKE FOREST
SHE STOPPED SHORT
WHO WOULDN'T BE TRYING TO FIND
LATER ON I CUT THE SHIT OUT OF MY ARMS I FELT OUT OF CONTROL WITH SELF HATE AND ANGUISH
I COULDN'T RESIST
MOM YOU NEED TO WAKE THE FUCK UP AND FORM YOUR THOUGHTS
YOU ARE NOT BEYOND
A FEMALE BABYSITTER
THAT'S A HUGE RED FLAG IN ITSELF
SO COMPARED TO THOSE GUYS IN YARD TALK
YOU NEED TO BE IN BED
RACIST
STUFF THAT TYLER SAYS HE WAS GOING TO USE TO BUILD A SMALL HOUSE WITH ON JOHN'S PROPERTY
ALONG WITH COORDINATES FOR K THREE LUMBER THE TRAILER PARK TYLER LIVES IN
I HATE CONFLICT
MY FAMILY WAS ONE OF THOSE

THOUGH IT WAS CLEAR THE BOX WAS FILLED WITH OTHERS TYLER SAYS
AND SHE JUST LIKE SITS IN IT
THAT IS TRAUMA
ANXIETY THAT A PROTESTOR MIGHT ATTACK ME PHYSICALLY ON THE WAY INTO THE ABORTION CLINIC
WOMAN WHO CALLS HERSELF SUNFLOWERS
YOU'RE LONGING FOR BUT NOT IN A SEXUAL CONTACT
AND THE SPLIT
BACK TO CURTIS AGAIN AND HIS STRUGGLE
WALK THROUGH THAT FEAR AND START TALKING ABOUT IT
I WAS A BABY AND I WAS SMOKING CIGARETTES DROPPING ACID I WAS IN HOLLYWOOD EVERY WEEKEND
BUT WE REALLY STRUGGLE TO PROCESS IT BECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE BEING OVERLY DRAMATIC OR MAKING TOO BIG OF A DEAL ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT OVER-DRAMATIC IS BUT I FELT THE NEED TO REPEAT THAT
YOU KNOW WERE THE FOUR CORE BELIEFS THAT I HAD ABOUT MYSELF AND
BOY THAT IS SO SIMILAR TO TO RYAN'S MOM WOW
HE GOT JEALOUS OF MY SISTER AND TRIED TO TURN ME AGAINST HER
BUT THAT STILL SUCKS
RAISED IN A PRETTY DYSFUNCTIONAL ENVIRONMENT
HOW DO YOU FEEL AFTER WRITING THIS DOWN RELIEVED AND FRIGHTENED
I'VE BEEN VERY OPEN WITH PEOPLE I MEET YOU KNOW
I SCORED A HAT TRICK AGAINST HIM
WE THINK THEO NEEDS BETTER COMPETITION AND
I EXPLAIN WHO I AM WHERE I WORK
IT SEEMS LIKE I CAN FEEL MILD GUILT SHAME ETCETERA
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS I FELT SO MUCH
BUT
LOVE THAT NAME
UM
THAT BEAD MEANT THE WORLD TO ME
WELL YOU SOUND KIND OF TIRED SO I'LL LET YOU GO

HIS REACTION SEE
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN ALONE IN OUR HEADS WITH SHAME FOR SO MUCH OF OUR LIVES
MY FINAL ACT OF DEFIANCE TOWARDS HER WAS WHEN I WAS INVITED TO HANG WITH MY FRIENDS THE NIGHT BEFORE GRADUATION
AND START TO PEEL THE LAYERS OF THE ONION OFF TO GET TO THE CORE OF
HAVE YOU EVER PICTURED YOUR MOM AS THE PERSON YOU'RE PUNCHING
FOR A LONG TIME I BELIEVED HER AND I WORKED TOWARDS THAT GOAL OF BECOMING CRAZY BECAUSE I THOUGHT
SO I HAD TO WAVE HIM OVER TO JOIN THE PARTY
I'M GOOD
AND I'M SO HAPPY THAT YOU SHARED THAT WITH ME
WORK A LOT MORE BEARABLE AND A GREAT ALTERNATIVE TO SMOKING

REMEMBERING HOW MUCH I HATED IT

YOUR EYES ARE EVEN CLOSED BECAUSE YOU'RE LIKE WHAT THE
YOU KNOW TAKING ONE LAST RUN AT THE STANLEY CUP WITH THE PERSONNEL THAT THEY HAD
AND TELL HIM I'VE DONE WHAT HE SUGGESTED CONTACTED THE OTHER FRIENDS ON THE TOP OF JOHN'S LIST AND INDEED NONE OF THEM WAS CALLED IN TIME FOR THE FUNERAL
TO ME TRUE SPIRITUALITY IS RELATIONSHIP
THAT'S LITERALLY MY FIRST MEMORY FROM CHILDHOOD THE FIRST COGENT MEMORY THAT I HAD
SOMETIMES I WISH YOU WOULD TALK ABOUT ADDICTION WITH THE SAME SORT OF COMPASSION THAT YOU USE TOWARDS PEOPLE WHO PRACTICE SELF-HARM I'VE DONE BOTH FOR THE SAME REASON
WHEN THAT GOES AWAY
RAPE IS RAPE IS RAPE IS RAPE BECAUSE
HE'S BEEN EMOTIONALLY ABUSED I'M A SKINNY DUDE AND HAVE BEEN MY WHOLE LIFE
BUT ALSO
YOU KNOW
I SEE A BUNCH OF SCRAMBLING LADS
WHATEVER IT WAS

YOU KNOW THAT IS REALLY REALLY NOT COOL OF YOUR WIFE TO SHAME YOU LIKE THAT
CONSTANTLY ON EDGE UM
THE VICTOR WALK HAS CHANGED THEIR LIFE
LIKE A FIRE IN MY GUT BURNING MYSELF FROM THE INSIDE OUT
I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE GONE TO THERAPY THEN CAUSE PERHAPS I COULD HAVE MADE THE PAST SIX YEARS OF MY SON'S LIFE BETTER

I ASKED HIM IF HE REMEMBERED THAT NIGHT AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN
I WANTED TO BE VERY CLEAR WITH THAT
IT TURNED OUT TO BE TWO PEN PALS
I KNOW NOW THAT I CAN ASK FOR WHAT I NEED AND THAT MY FRIENDS WILL SHOW UP TO HELP ME AS THEY CAN
UNFORGIVEN
WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN I LEARNED WHAT TRANSGENDER MEANT AND CRIED FROM HAPPINESS
AND THEN
OR AT LEAST SINCE I ANNOUNCED IT
AFTER JOHN'S PHONE CALL FAYE RUSHED OVER TO HIS HOUSE ALONG WITH THE WOODSTOCK POLICE
BECAUSE I HAD A SEXUAL VIBE I DON'T KNOW

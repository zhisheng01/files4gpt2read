THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT AND YOU KNOW WHY I WANTED TO END WITH THAT
WOW THAT IS A GOOD ONE
HOLY SHIT
NO I SAID
I RAN OUT OF MY BEDROOM GRABBED TWO HANDFULS OF ICE CUBES FROM THE FREEZER AND BEGAN RUBBING THEM ON MY FACE STOMACH AND LEGS
FILL THOSE OUT MORE
HE IS
ECHO
YOU KNOW RELATIONSHIPS ARE REALLY HARD FOR US AFTER TRAUMA
SO
ALRIGHT CONTINUING
UM
NEXT TIME ON EAR HUSTLE MY CELLIE T WAS A GUY WHO WAS A PROLIFIC RUNNER AND AN EXERCISER
HE SAID QUOTE
AT LEAST NOT ANYTIME SOON
AND THERE'S A LOT OF DEDICATION THAT HAS TO HAPPEN IN ORDER FOR YOU TO ACCOMPLISH THAT
OR DONATIONS LATELY AND
THE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE WAS NOT GOOD
CURTAIN STAGE WHERE YOU CAN'T SEE IT
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A SWITCH WENT OFF
MY OPINION THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOUR
DR JONICE WEBB J O N I C E
BUT
I'VE TRIED TO TALK TO MY WIFE ABOUT IT
BUT THEN I'LL KEEP DELAYING THE COURT CASE BY FILING MOTIONS
SNAPSHOT FROM THEIR LIFE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I OFTEN FELT PHYSICALLY EMPTY AND LIKE I WAS FLOATING
BUT I HAD THAT FEELING WHICH IS
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS FOR SURE SOME OTHER THINGS HAD DISAPPEARED BY THEN THINGS
I GUESS THERE'S A HUSTLE FOR EVERYTHING
I'M TERRIFIED OF DYING AND ITS CONSEQUENCES
AND THAT'S JUST KIND OF WHERE I'M AT RIGHT NOW AND I GUESS IT HELPS KNOWING THAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH THAT BEFORE AND COME OUT OF IT BUT WHEN I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF IT
CURTIS SAID HE'LL BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE WHEN HE'S SERVED FIFTY YEARS
BUT I HAVE A LITTLE FUNNY CAT AND HE ALWAYS I GET IN BED I PUT THE COVERS OVER ME
I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYONE I FEEL AWFUL I ALSO CAN'T STOP WORRYING THAT SOMETHING HORRIBLE WILL HAPPEN TO MY DAUGHTER AND IT WOULD BE THE END OF ME I REMIND HER ALL THE TIME THAT SHE'S IN CONTROL OF HERSELF AND TO BE OPEN
AND NOW HE UNFORTUNATELY SAYS THE SAME
IT IS NOT YOUR CHOICE TO HANG ON TO IT THAT IS THERE BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT TRAUMA DOES AND SO DO NOT SHAME YOURSELF FOR STILL HAVING THOSE FEELINGS
IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING
BEAUTIFUL MOMENT THAT
THEY'RE GONNA ADMIT YOU THEY'LL BE WAITING OUT FRONT
I ACCEPT BOTH OF THOSE
BIG-HEARTED
TO PROTECT HIS IDENTITY WE CAN'T REVEAL TOO MANY DETAILS ABOUT WHEN AND WHERE
EVEN IF THAT PERSON ISN'T
WHOLENESS IS WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE STRIVING FOR
AND IF WE DON'T EXPRESS THE SADNESS
THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THAT FOR SOMEBODY AND AND YOU KNOW
HEY MOM AND DAD
THIS IS
LIKE I WAS EXACTLY WHERE I BELONG
THE SUBJECT LINE SAYS I WANT TO COME TO YOU FROM RUSSIA YOU DO NOT MIND
YOU LITTLE SHITBAG ASSHOLE
SHE HAD A FLASHBACK OF HER BOYFRIEND TRYING TO STRANGLE HER
SHE TOLD ME THAT IF I WAS GOING TO KEEP QUOTE BEING LIKE THIS THEN SHE WASN'T COMFORTABLE LETTING ME GO TO COLLEGE IN THE FALL HER ANGER MADE MY SYMPTOMS WORSE AND SHE LEFT ME ALONE IN THE HOUSE
BECAUSE OF THE LOCKDOWN GUYS AREN'T WORKING RIGHT NOW SO THEY AREN'T GETTING THAT SMALL BIT OF MONEY THAT HELPS THEM BUY FOOD AT CANTEEN AND INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE CHOW HALL THEY'RE GETTING FOOD DELIVERED TO THEIR CELLS IN BOXES
IS AS POWERFUL A PART OF THE FANTASY AS THE
FEEL OR HAVE FELT LIKE YOU DO
SO THAT IS NO REFLECTION ON YOU AS A PERSON SO STOP BEATING YOURSELF UP ABOUT THAT
SO THEN YOU CAN GRAB ONTO SOMEBODY ELSE'S LINE
LIKE IF SOMETHING'S GOING TO GO DOWN I'M GOING TO RUN AWAY OR I'M GOING TO PREPARE MYSELF FOR IT IN SOME WAY
FUCKING EXPLORE IT YOU KNOW
YOU CAN HELP BY TRYING TO GET SOMETHING PUT IN
THESE FIRST SEVEN NAMES AT THE TOP
I REMEMBER WE WERE IN DENVER
TO EVERYDAY COMPULSIVE NEGATIVE THINKING
NORMALLY I'M NOT VERY EMOTIONALLY OPEN WITH MY FRIENDS THERE HAVE BEEN EXCEPTIONS BUT THAT'S MY DEFAULT BUT SINCE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT DEPRESSION AND STUFF
ACTUALLY WE DID A LITTLE WHILE AGO I THINK IT WAS MAYBE SIX MONTHS AGO WITH UM
YES
JAW-DROPPING
MY THERAPIST AND I DISCUSSED GRIPPING ICE CUBES WHENEVER I FEEL THE NEED TO PUNISH MYSELF OR TO USE THE ICE AS A COPING SKILL WHEN I BECOME OVERHEATED OR PANICKED
THIS KEEPS COMING BACK
AMEN AMEN ABSOLUTELY THANKS GUYS THANK YOU
HE BROKE UP WITH ME HIS ROOMMATE CAME IN THE ROOM I WAS STAYING IN AND HAD SEX WITH ME
AND
HOW DO YOU FEEL AFTER WRITING THESE THINGS DOWN LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO RECOGNIZE BITS AND PIECES OF MY STORY FROM OTHER SURVEYS I'VE FILLED OUT HA HA
HOW DOES SHE
WHERE I SPENT ALL MY TIME ASLEEP I THEN SPENT A WEEK IN A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL I WAS VEGAN AT THE TIME
FEELING GUILTY AND ANXIOUS BUT STILL BEING TOO TIRED AND HOPELESS TO GET OUT OF BED OR OFF THE COUCH TO GO OUTSIDE AND ENJOY IT
THEIR GANGS HAVE TIGHT POWER STRUCTURES
I HOPE
THE WIND LEFT MY LUNGS AND THE ONLY THING I REMEMBER THINKING IS PERFECT LOVE CASTS OUT FEAR AND THAT MY BODY LITERALLY WILLED ITSELF TO LIFE AS I VOWED TO FIGURE OUT
I THINK IT FUELED MY FANTASIES ABOUT BEING SEXUALLY SUBMISSIVE TO SOMEONE
GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE OKAY
AS FOR THE QUESTION OF JOHN'S ASSETS
YOU CAN ACTUALLY BLACK OUT IN RAGE
KIND OF REMINDS ME OF THE
WHAT WOULD IT HAVE BEEN AT
YEAH YOUR MOM IS AH
I EXPERIENCED THIS PEACE LIKE I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE OR SINCE SADLY
I HAD ASKED THEM IF IT'D BE ALL RIGHT IF I CAN UM
I SKATED OUT AT THE START OF THE SECOND PERIOD
I THINK THAT'S THE COOLEST THING ABOUT BEING A MOM IN RECOVERY IS TO HAVE A CLUE WHAT THE HANDBOOK TO LIFE IS AND ACTUALLY BE TEACHING SOME OF THAT STUFF
YOU KNOW SEE HIM AROUND KIDS AND COACHING KIDS AND SO HE
AND A USELESS FUCKFACE
MAKE SURE I GOT OUT OF THE DOOR ON TIME AND JUST BE WITH ME
YOU KNOW UM
UM WE WERE ABLE TO STAY WITH MY GRANDMOTHER UNTIL FEBRUARY
AND I APOLOGIZED
YEAH
YOU COULD TELL HE WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PURGE AND THEN IT'S A CRASH OR FOR YOU IS IT RIGHT AFTER THE PURGE IT'S IMMEDIATE CRASH

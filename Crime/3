OFTEN IT EVEN GOES INTO THE TERRITORY OF DARKER RAPE-Y' DEPICTIONS OF THEM AS WELL
SO
OF TWO PEOPLE WHO'VE EXPERIENCED TRAUMA
I BURST OUT LAUGHING
NORMALLY WE DON'T FOCUS ON THE CRIMES THAT PEOPLE HAVE COMMITTED
THERE'S AN ASIAN GIRL ON YOUTUBE WHO TEACHES YOU LIKE EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO WITH YOUR HAIR I'VE SEEN HER BEFORE BECAUSE I DON'T DO MUCH WITH MY HAIR
ARE
AND I HAVE MORE HOURS LATELY THAN USUAL WHICH IS HARD ON MY BODY AND SOUL BUT AT LEAST IT'S GOOD BECAUSE I ALONE AM RESPONSIBLE TO SUPPORT BOTH OF US FINANCIALLY WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE TO HELP US STACY'S HUSBAND IS IN PRISON IN SOLIDAD CALIFORNIA
I JUST WANTED TO PUNISH MYSELF FOR NOT BEING A NORMAL PERFECT GIRL FOR NOT BEING WHO ANYONE REALLY WANTED IN THEIR LIFE
AND HE ALSO HAS
NEITHER DID THE LIGHTNING OR THE SCARED SQUEALS OF MY CLASSMATES
I SAT THERE CRYING AND FEELING TRAPPED
UM
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH OUR FAMILY TYPE OF FAMILIES
AND REMEMBER THAT
TOOK A PIECE OF STEEL
ANGRY AND LONELY
IT JUST BREAKS MY HEART
IT'S PRODUCED BY A GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH TIES TO THE PRISON INCLUDING OUR RECENTLY RELEASED FRIEND JONATHAN CHIU
I COULDN'T
I WANTED TO TELL SOMEONE BUT HE USED THE THREAT THAT I WOULD HAVE TO MOVE TO ANOTHER SCHOOL AND WOULD LOSE ALL MY FRIENDS
ELIJAH IS IN SAN QUENTIN NOW AND THINGS HAVE DEFINITELY GOTTEN BETTER FOR HIM
AND THEN YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU GOTTA MAKE A DECISION AM I GONNA TO DIE OR AM I GONNA LIVE YOU KNOW
HOWEVER I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO YOUR PODCAST FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND I ACTUALLY FIND THE AMOUNT OF SWEARING HELPFUL
I FEEL NOTHING TOWARDS HIM I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH HIM BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL HIM
I DON'T KNOW WHY MOTHER IS IN QUOTES AH
AND MY FRIENDS
MANY MANY THANKS TO CHRISTINA BOY I REALLY ENJOYED TALKING TO HER
EXACTLY
YOU JUST YOU JUST SOUND LIKE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL
I WANTED TO QUIT LIVING BECAUSE I WAS SO UPSET WITH MYSELF THAT I COULDN'T DO THIS THING THAT I REALLY WANTED TO DO THAT WAS GOING TO PROVE THAT I WASN'T THAT DAMAGED AFTER ALL OKAY AND IF I COULDN'T PROVE THAT
APART FROM MEALS MED CHECKS
UM
IT ALMOST KILLED ME
IF YOU HAVE
THAT I REALLY STARTED TO CONNECT WITH WOMEN AND FEEL THEM THAT
AND UNTIL THEY WERE WELL PAST THE TODDLER STAGE I WAS CONSTANTLY OVERWHELMED BY THEM AND THEIR NEEDS
HOPE THAT MADE SENSE NO YOU KNOW WHAT
I'VE BEEN GOING NONSTOP AND I'M FUCKING EXHAUSTED
TWO HUNDRED METERS FROM THE CLINIC
THIS IS A STRUGGLE IN A SENTENCE FILLED OUT BY CAN I JUST GO BACK TO PLAYING WITH LEGOS
AT THE VERY END OF THE FIRST PERIOD THEO HAD GOTTEN INTO A SCRUM WITH BLUES TOUGH GUY TYSON NASH AND WORDS WERE EXCHANGED
BOTH MY DOGS HAVE CONES ON THEIR HEADS RIGHT NOW I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ALLERGIES IN THE AIR
AND BE AROUND NO NONE OF OUR NETWORK OF FRIENDS WHO WERE ALL WE HAD AT THIS POINT BECAUSE WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THIS MOTHER
I HAVE PANIC ATTACKS EVERY DAY IN FEAR THAT I WILL GET SICK
NOT EVERY FRIEND YEAH BUT MANY YEAH
SO WHAT WOULD BE THE NEXT I KNOW I HAD SOME OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT
THOUGH IMMEDIATELY REPORTING CERTAINLY WOULD'VE BEEN LOGISTICALLY BETTER
UM
FIRST HE WROTE SOME LETTERS TO HIS DAUGHTER BUT THEY CAME BACK STAMPED RETURN TO SENDER
SO
AND
YOU KNOW NO MATTER HOW FAR DOWN THE LADDER WE MAY FALL WE CAN ALWAYS GET OURSELVES BACK UP AND DUST OURSELVES OFF AND AND
WERE YOU JUST CONSTANTLY ON EDGE
LET'S SEE I'M READING THIS LIST QUICKLY
I WAS GOBSMACKED BUT JOYFUL
I TRIED TO KEEP UP WITH THE CONVERSATION
WHAT CAN I SAY
AND MY GRANDMOTHER UM
I'M GONNA READ SOME SURVEYS
THAT HAVEN'T HAD THE SEXUAL ABUSE
TECH CRUNCH AND CBS
BUT I'M LIKE YOU RUINED ALL OF THAT
DEALING WITH THE REPERCUSSIONS OF
HAPPY JOYOUS
UM
I WISH THAT I COULD BE FINANCIALLY DEPENDENT
AND
THAT IS PROFOUND
I'LL BE PROUD TO SAY THAT YOU'RE MY BROTHER
AND THEN I'M GONNA APOLOGIZE A THIRD TIME
AND UM
ON
GIVEN A PERFECT STORM OR THE RIGHT SITUATIONS
DEEPEST SECRETS
THEY UNDERSTAND AND THEY HAVE COMPLETE EMPATHY AND COMPASSION BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE IT TOO AND THEY GET IT TOO HE WAS SUCH A NORMIE
I WAS ON HOLD FOR AN HOUR
BAIL BECAUSE OF THAT
AND ALL WE WANTED TO BE WAS WITH OUR FATHER MY YOUNGEST BROTHER WAS TRULY TORN
I WAS BORN IN BOSTON MASSACHUSETTS
THIS ONE REALLY NEEDS AN ADVISORY THE FOLLOWING EPISODE CONTAINS DISTURBING SUBJECT MATTER AND GRAPHIC DEPICTIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE OF MINORS
THIS MAKES HER HAPPY
AND
AND I WOULD ALWAYS FEEL IT IN MY STOMACH JUST EXTREME FEAR THAT THEY WERE GOING TO GET YOU KNOW DIVORCED OR THAT SHE WAS GOING TO LEAVE OR WHO WAS I GOING TO LIVE WITH THAT THIS MISERY WAS GOING TO BE SHATTERED
YOU KNOW I WENT DOWN FOR THE FIRST MONTH I DON'T THINK I SCORED A GOAL IN THE FIRST MONTH THAT I WAS THERE
WHAT'S CHRIS HANSEN LIKE IN PERSON
BUT IN A BUNCH OF OTHER DIRECTIONS TOO
AND THEY HAVE TO WATCH THEIR BACKS BECAUSE IF THEY'RE EXPOSED
AND A COUPLE OF COMMAS
BALTIMORE IS AN INTERESTING CITY MAN
I WILL NEVER FORGET EVERY SINGLE SENSATION I FELT IN THOSE MOMENTS
NOW I'M BEATING MYSELF UP FOR HOW LONG-WINDED THAT WAS AND I'M AFRAID THAT PEOPLE ARE GONNA JUDGE ME
RELATED TO THE ORIGINAL ABUSE OUR FANTASIES CAN BE SOMETIMES HOW MUCH IT'S US WANTING TO GET IN A TIME MACHINE AND GO BACK AND HAVE A REDO BUT HAVE CONTROL
IT WAS CRAZY BECAUSE
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SHARE WITH THAT INDIVIDUAL THAT YOU CAN COME TO TERMS WITH THIS
PEOPLE
FOR EVERY COWARDLY ACT OR FEELING WITHIN YOU
DO YOU STILL HAVE MY FATHER'S BOAT
AND I REMEMBER THINKING
THAT KIND OF TRAUMA

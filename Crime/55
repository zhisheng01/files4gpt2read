SHE WRITES WHEN I WAS SITTING IN MY ROOM WITH NO LIGHTS ON ONE AFTERNOON AROUND SIX LOOKING OUT MY WINDOW AT THE SUNSET
THEN I WILL BUT WHAT I'M DOING IS
HEART-BREAKING POETICALLY BEAUTIFUL
EVEN SOME GUYS IN HERE ARE GONNA WONDER LET EM WONDER WE'LL GET TO OLD FI-FI LATER IN THE PODCAST
THIS IS FROM THE SHAME AND SECRETS SURVEY FILLED OUT BY
THOUGHT
AND SOME AMERICAN GIRLFRIENDS THAT MY DAD HAD LIKE HE DATED THIS ALBERTSON'S CHECKOUT GIRL
THOUGHT LET'S LET'S WATCH MOVIES OF HER LET'S REMEMBER HER FONDLY BECAUSE SHE PASSED AWAY FROM CANCER AND WAS UNRECOGNIZABLE IN THE END
IT WAS THE LAST DAY OF FEBRUARY THAT I SAW HIM
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THIS REALLY WAS THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME THAT HE WOULD HAVE
AND I NEVER TOLD HIM
AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO STAY THAT WAY
I JUST
I CRIED SO HARD I COULD BARELY BREATHE AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHY
FORGIVE MY IGNORANCE
NO IDEA IF HE EVER YELLED OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT NONE OF US HEARD ANYTHING
TYLER TELLS ME THEY'VE GUTTED THE DAMN PLACE
THE ACTUAL FANTASY MAKES ME FEEL LIKE SUCH A PERVERT ESPECIALLY WHEN I GET TURNED ON BY SEEING A MOTHER BREAST-FEEDING I FEEL LIKE A PERVERTED OLD MAN
YOU HAVE NO WRINKLES
E
ONCE ON THE WARD EVERYONE'S GOAL SEEMED TO BE TO GET OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
THE LESS IT TAKES TO BRING YOU PEACE
THIS AH LITTLE PIECE THAT KERRY HAD WRITTEN ABOUT UM
FAILED RELATIONSHIP I'M IN AND I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE PERSON THAT ALWAYS POINTED THE FINGER AND BLAMED SOMEONE ELSE ALL THE TIME I KNOW I HAVE MY SHIT CLEARLY I HAVE MY SHIT AND I WANTED TO GO BETTER UNDERSTAND IT BETTER HANDLE IT
I BEGAN TO USE ALCOHOL MORE FREQUENTLY THAN EVER AND BY SUMMER I WAS ARRESTED FOR A DUI DURING MY BRIEF TIME IN JAIL I WAS LOCKED IN A CELL WITH A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN WHO HAD ALSO BEEN DRINKING AND DRIVING SHE ENDED UP TELLING ME A BIT OF HER LIFE STORY
I LOVE SIMPLE MOMENTS LIKE THAT MAN
IS A HAPPY MOMENT FILLED OUT BY AMANDA THE CAT LADY
TAKING THIS STEP ALONE WAS ONE OF THE HAPPIEST MOMENTS OF MY LIFE
AND I THINK FOR ALL THESE OTHER MEN AT LEAST FROM MY EXPERIENCE ON THE WALK
UM
PROBABLY BOTH
SO
YOU KNOW
IS
THAT WAS JUST SO GOOD I HAD TO READ THAT THAT WAS
AND SHE WRITES I'M AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE AND IT'S THE MORNING OF MY FIRST DAY AT A NEW JOB I NEVER SHOW UP TO THE OFFICE AND I'M TRYING TO ANTICIPATE HOW MY MOM WILL REACT WHEN SHE COMES HOME AND DISCOVERS THAT ALL MY INTERVIEWING AND JOB SEARCHING WAS FOR NOTHING
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS
I AM ALREADY HATING THAT ANALOGY
WELL ANDREW THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING AND SHARING YOUR LIFE WITH US AND BEING HONEST ABOUT YOUR STRUGGLES AS A PARENT I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT
A SICK PERSON
AND THEN FOR THE SHADOW THE LIPSTICK AND THE ROUGE
I DON'T KNOW IF MOST NORMAL PEOPLE EVEN KNOW YOU CAN DO THAT
THEN IT WAS JUST DONE LIKE I WAS GOING TO PUT MYSELF TO BED LIKE JUST
THIS IS A SHAME AND SECRETS SURVEY FILLED OUT BY KATE
ABOUT THE STEPS THEY'RE TAKING TO GET THEM OUT OF THE PICTURE
I THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN THROUGH TO GET TO THIS POINT WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL AT SOME POINT I MUST HAVE STOPPED SEEING A FUTURE FOR MYSELF
THAT IS
YOU CAN JOIN THE FORUM YOU CAN SUPPORT THE SHOW FINANCIALLY YOU CAN READ BLOGS BY ME AND OTHER PEOPLE
MOST OF THESE MEN DIDN'T KNOW EACH OTHER BEYOND MAYBE HAVING INTERACTED ONCE OR TWICE IN HOROLOGICAL CIRCLES OVER THE YEARS THE MEN TALKED TO ME FOR HOURS WITHOUT BATTING AN EYE
WHAT ARE YOUR SPORTS
AND THEN THE JUDGE ASKED MY MOTHER AND MY MOTHER SAID YOU KNOW I WANT TODD
AND SHE HAS BEEN PLAYING YOU LIKE A PUPPET SINCE YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL
SO I JUST DON'T WANT IT TO COME BACK ANYMORE AND SO THIS WAS MY SOLUTION
FUCK YOU YOU FUCKING SELFISH MOTHERFUCKER
SHE SAYS SHE DIDN'T TALK TO YOU
AND I ONLY SAY THAT YOU HAVE A PART IN THIS SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A CHOICE
IT WOULD BE STAFF THAT BROUGHT IT IN BECAUSE ONCE VOLUNTEERS LIKE ME STOPPED GOING IN
SO YOU MIGHT FEEL LIKE SHIT BUT YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL GOOD
THOUGH I'M NOT SURE THERE'S MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING LONELY AND THINKING YOU ARE
SO
AND WHEN THERE'S A LOCKDOWN YOU MIGHT NOT GET OUT FOR WEEKS
DON'T WALK
NOBODY WANT TO EAT WITH THEM NOBODY WANT TO WORK WITH THEM
WHICH MEANS THEY WERE IN HIS YARD AT LEAST THREE YEARS BEFORE THE DATES THAT ARE ON TYLER'S BILLS OF SALE
AND SO
SHE IS BISEXUAL IN HER TWENTY S RAISED IN A PRETTY DYSFUNCTIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND I JUST WANT TO READ
THIS IS AN AWFULSOME MOMENT FILLED OUT BY A GUY WHO CALLS HIMSELF ASH CATCH'M AND
I REMEMBER VERY CLEARLY HER SAYING
THIS IS AN AWFULSOME MOMENT FILLED OUT BY TRAUMAMOMMA
AND YOU MIGHT BE A SEX AND LOVE ADDICT AS WELL
LIKE US
YOU CAN BUY SOME TOOTHPASTE AND A NICE TOOTHBRUSH
AT LEAST THE BRUISE WOULD'VE HEALED QUICKER THAN THE HAIR TO CALM DOWN I SUPPOSE
AND FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HIS AFFAIRS
AND GAS AND THINGS THAT WE NEED AND MY MOTHER IN FRONT OF MY GRANDMOTHER
I WANTED TO SHOOT THEM ALL IN THE HEAD
I DIDN'T EXPECT FOR THAT TO HAPPEN
MY FATHER EMANCIPATED ME FROM THE FAMILY LAST YEAR AND YET THEY CONTINUE TO REACH OUT TO ME ON BIRTHDAYS
THAT WOULD REALLY FUCK ME UP
JUST LISTENING
YOU KNOW ONCE YOU GET ON THE OTHER SIDE
CAUSE THE DAYS OF DESKS
I'VE HELD MY NIECE AFTER BEING AWAKE FOR THREE DAYS ON A METH BINGE
DID HE GET HIT LIKE WHAT
ANYWAY GO AHEAD
WOW
THE GOAL
JUST COATING IT ALL IN LIKE THIS
OR MY FAVORITE BECOME A MONTHLY DONOR FOR AS LITTLE AS FIVE BUCKS A MONTH AND IT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A LOT OF MONEY TO YOU
THEY WOULD SEND ME NEXT DOOR TO A BABYSITTER
RAHSAAN NEW YORK THOMAS JOHN YAHYA JOHNSON AND PAT MESITI-MILLER AND ON THE OUTSIDE BY ME
TRYING TO CARRY ON
SOMETIMES FEEL IN THE RELATIONSHIP
I STARTED BLASTING SUBLIME CARESS ME DOWN CAME UP ON THE PLAYLIST AND SHE AND I JUST STARTED BELTING OUT THE LYRICS AS WE RODE DOWN THE TWISTING COUNTRY ROADS ON THE WAY TO THE CITY
I'M SO SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO EXPERIENCE ALL OF THAT AND UM
OK WHEN I HEAR A SENTENCE LIKE THAT FOR THE KIND OF CRIME HE COMMITTED
SO INSTEAD I'LL DRIVE MYSELF CLOSE TO THE EDGE AND ALMOST GO OVER IT WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED
SPREADING THE WORD THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA
GROUND TURKEY TACO SHARES A SNAPSHOT FROM HIS ANGER ISSUES
I THINK BECAUSE I WISH THAT I HAD THE ABILITY TO COME LIKE THAT

NOT CHRISTIAN NOT HAPPY NEEDY AS HELL CRY MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY
HE COULD GET JOHN EXCITED AND REDIRECT HIS ATTITUDE SO THAT BY THE END OF THE SESSION HE'D SEEMED LIFTED OUT OF HIS DESPAIR
UM
IT'S GOING TO FEEL SO MUCH BETTER TO YOU THAN IT DOES TO SOMEBODY WHO FEELS GOOD ALL THE TIME
THEY TOOK ME MORE SERIOUSLY THAN ANYONE EVER HAS
UM
YOU KNOW THAT
AND NOT CAUSING ANY MORE WRECKAGE YOU KNOW
A CLOCK THE MAN RETRIEVED HIMSELF FROM A CRYPT NEAR GREILING GERMANY
BEST WISHES LOUISE
SHE'S TWENTY EIGHT NOW ONCE YOU'RE IN PRISON IF YOUR FAMILY WANTS YOU OUT OF THEIR LIVES THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT YOU HAVE NO CONTROL WELL IN CURTIS'S CASE HE DID TRY TO DO SOMETHING
MUCH SIMPLER YEAH AND YOU KNOW LIVING A DRAMA FREE LIFE WHERE
IT DISTURBED ALLEN NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT CAUSED HIM TO MISS HIS FRIEND'S FUNERAL
NONE OF US CAN RELATE TO THAT ONE
NOW IT'S TIME TO CHECK BOTH ALARM CLOCKS FOR A FEW MINUTES
ABOUT BEING A SEX CRIME VICTIM TOOK ME ABOUT FOUR YEARS TO SAY IT OUT LOUD I COULD NOT AND DID NOT CONSENT
THIS IS AN AWFUL-SOME MOMENT
AT THE FRONT OF IT
HAS BEEN BY THE WAY INSANELY PATIENT AND UNDERSTANDING I THINK THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING
NOW
IT WAS SOME BROTHERS CAME DOWN FROM SOLITARY RIGHT
AND IT'S SO ARTICULATE
IT FEELS SO EMPTY
IT WAS ALWAYS COMPLETELY SOMEBODY ELSE'S FAULT
BUT MY THOUGHT IS
THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE THAT WEAR LIPSTICK VERY WELL
I DON'T WANT ANY SEX TO BE RECIPROCATED I DON'T EVEN WANT TO BE NAKED AROUND OTHER PEOPLE
GOT FIRED FROM IT OR WHATEVER IT'S LIKE
HAVEN'T WON EM ALL
ABOUT BEING A COMPULSIVE MASTURBATOR LIKE A DRUG DEALER STANDING OUTSIDE MY DOOR MAKING THE SAME SALES PITCH EVERY DAY IT'S FREE EASY GOOD FOR YOUR PROSTATE AND YOU CAN TAKE IT AT WORK
NO WOMEN
EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT
YOU CAN STILL LOVE YOUR DAD AND HAVE COMPASSION FOR YOUR DAD WHILE ALSO
UM
I PICKED HIM UP AND OPENED THE MICROWAVE
IS
HOW DO YOU FREAK OUT
PROBABLY EVER ACTUALLY
MY FAVORITE SPAMS ARE THE ONES THAT START WITH HELLO DEAR
SO IT'S LIKE
I WOULD START WITH SAFER PEOPLE TO SHARE THIS WITH
AND IT'S SUCH A WASTE
AND THEN SHE WRITES MY BOYFRIEND WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN TOOK NUDE PHOTOS OF ME AND THEN SHARED THEM ONLINE
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
THE GAY COMMUNITY
THEY ASKED ME IF I NEEDED RESOURCES FOR HELP
AND THAT'S HONESTLY
THIS EPISODE WAS SCORED WITH MUSIC BY DAVID JASSY WITH CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ANTWAN WILLIAMS AND LEE JASPER
FAIR ENOUGH A LITTLE EXTREME BUT I'VE HEARD WORSE IT WAS THE PLAYOFFS
THERE'S A LOT OF IGNORANCE ABOUT
SHE'S STRAIGHT IN HER THIRTIES RAISED IN A PRETTY DYSFUNCTIONAL ENVIRONMENT
BUT FOR CURTIS
ABSOLUTELY
SHE WOULD PUT ME DOWN WHEN I SHOWED THAT I HAD GOTTEN DECENT GRADES WHICH IN HINDSIGHT IS PROBABLY BECAUSE SHE WAS UNEDUCATED AND THE THOUGHT OF SOMEONE SUCCEEDING IN LIFE WAS UNBEARABLE TO HER
LIKE VERY HARD
AND THEY WOULD TAKE IT FURTHER
RIGHT
DISAPPOINTMENT
CHANCE NUMBER THREE
LEILA LEFT
I'M NOT CREATING DRAMA AND I'M NOT ALLOWING OTHERS TO CREATE DRAMA IN MY LIFE AS WELL YOU KNOW
LAST NIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANIC ATTACK
CYCLOPS THIRTY-TWO
AND AGAIN
YEAH THAT'S SO TRUE
HE WOULD TELL ME I MEANT NOTHING TO HIM AND THAT I WOULD NEVER AMOUNT TO ANYTHING BECAUSE I DIDN'T GIVE HIM MONEY FOR QUOTE CIGARETTES
UM
AND I LEARNED ABOUT CONSEQUENCES TOO RIGHT AND SO
I COULD NOT FUCKING RESIST
LOOK GOOD IN A TUXEDO
SUICIDAL THOUGHTS YOU KNOW
WORKING ON THAT ONE
YOU KNOW SORT OF PAINFUL
EVEN WHEN I MOVE OUT I'M NEVER GOING TO BE HAPPY WITH THE WAY I LOOK OR SOUND
SUCH AS AN ANCIENT PROCESS FOR MAKING THINGS GOLD KNOWN AS FIRE GILDING THAT IS VERY DANGEROUS AND ILLEGAL IN SOME PLACES
CLOTHING FROM A DIFFERENT SOCIO-ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
I GOT MY HYPODERMIC NEEDLES AND SYRINGES AT THE LIVESTOCK FARM STORE
AND
I'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE FROM OTHER GUYS HERE
YOU KNOW
SO
AH YOUR GUYS NAMES
I ALSO FEEL LIKE I WAS MAYBE OVER-SEXUALIZED INADVERTENTLY AS A CHILD
HE WAS IN THE EPISODE ABOUT THE UNWRITTEN RULES OF RACE
PLUS I WAS BORED AND STARTING TO GET CABIN FEVER
TO SOMEBODY TO BE IN A SITUATION AND REALIZE THERE IS TRULY NO ONE HERE THAT CARES THERE'S NO ONE HERE THAT HAS SYMPATHY
HOW TO SAY IT WHEN TO SAY IT
YOU KNOW
AND IT'S LIKE OF COURSE STILLNESS WAS SCARY YOU KNOW THAT SILENCE WAS AWFUL
IN RECOVERY FOR TEN YEARS AND I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYBODY EVER BE MADE FUN OF FOR NOT
AND IT BRINGS UP SUCH INTENSE EMOTIONS IN ME JUST
DESPITE JOHN HAVING SAID THAT HE WANTED TO LEAVE MONEY AND GOLD TO TYLER
JUDGE POW WILL EXPLAIN TO TYLER THAT THIS HEARING ISN'T ABOUT HIS STUFF
I KNOW MINE WAS
TO BE A WOMAN
HIDING THAT I DRINK FROM MY PARENTS EVEN THOUGH I'M TWENTY-TWO AND THEY WOULD MOST LIKELY BE FINE WITH IT
BUT WE ARE IN A MUCH BETTER PLACE NOW AND I'M GLAD I GOT THE HELP I NEEDED AND CAME OUT ABOUT IT IN THE END
IT BECOMES INSTANTLY OVERWHELMING
MY LIFE JUST SKYROCKETED INTO ANOTHER DIMENSION
AND WE PLAYED SOME HOCKEY

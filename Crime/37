AND FEELING SO EXPOSED AND SELF CONSCIOUS
SO
IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE AND IT'S NOT GOING TO STOP BECAUSE ALL WE'RE DOING IS HIDING IT
AND IT'S JUST GOING OVER MY HEAD
HE WROTE ABOUT HOROLOGY CONSULTED ON HOROLOGY BOOKS
LOOKED ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYES AND TOLD ME THAT I CAN BE THE SHOW STEALER IF I WANTED TO AND THAT SHE KNOWS I CAN
WHAT IF ANYTHING WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO SOMEONE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
I CAN THINK OF A TRAIL BY MY HOUSE
YOU KNOW PREDATORS AND VICTIMS IDENTIFY WITH EACH OTHER BECAUSE IT'S A CYCLE
UM I GUESS I ENJOYED MEETING NEW PEOPLE AND BEING ABLE TO TELL MY STORY AGAIN AND AGAIN AND ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I LEARNED ABOUT THERAPY IS IT IS REPETITION
AT FIRST SHE WAS OK WITH IT UNTIL SHE SAW THAT MY FRIENDS WERE ALL WHITE
OF COURSE NOT I'M LIKE
AND MY MOTHER HAD A BOYFRIEND AT THE TIME
UNTIL THAT PANIC GOES AWAY
I CAN THINK ABOUT WORK THE WHOLE TIME BUT IT
IT'S LIKE MAN NOW YOU NEED SOME INGENUITY
YES AND ALSO LIKE
NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT
AND THEN THERE'S ME
I PULLED OUT AND I SCRATCHED A CAR AND I KNOW IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS IN THAT FOG
I THINK I STILL
I SAID IT'S
STARTING A BUSINESS
I SUBSTITUTE LOVE AND
BUT THEY ARE REALLY TEARS OF HEALING YOUR SOUL AND HEALING THAT
BUT SHE WROTE
E AND I WENT OUT TO THE YARD TO TALK TO SOME THREE-STRIKERS ABOUT THEIR SENTENCES MY NAME IS STACY BULLOCK
THAT LITTLE WORD MEANT SO MUCH TO ME
JUST
THAT HE WAS A GREAT COACH AND THAT HE WOULD EVENTUALLY ASSEMBLE A GREAT TEAM IN
AND UM
I SAID LET'S PLAY SOME HOCKEY
YOU KNOW
AND EACH OF THOSE NAMES IS A MYSTERY TO ME
HE INCLUDES THE WORDS MAYBE I KNEW TOO MUCH
THINGS THAT
LATER IN LIFE UM
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS AT MY LOWEST
ON A DAILY BASIS
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE DRINKING
IS SEEKING HELP
AND ONCE I WAS ABLE TO SEE THAT I HAD BROUGHT SOMETHING TO THE TABLE THAT WAS LESS THAN IDEAL
AND THEN I WOULD GET STUCK I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I WOULD THINK MOVE
HOW YOU DOING WITH YOUR HIGHER POWER AND I'M LIKE
UNDER PROP SIXTY SIX YOUR SENTENCE MIGHT BE DRAMATICALLY REDUCED YEAH IT WAS GONNA BE A HUGE CHANGE
UM TO ME OBVIOUSLY THE MEAT OF IT WHICH JUST PROVED WE ARE NOT ALONE AND WHAT I FOUND SO MOVING WAS THE HUGS TALK ABOUT THE HUGS THEO
CONTINUING
YOU KNOW
OH MAN THAT BREAKS MY HEART
NAKED PICTURES OF HER ONLINE
SHE WAS THE VICTIM OF SEXUAL ABUSE AND NEVER REPORTED IT AND SHE WRITES ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO
BUT DO NOT QUOTE ME ON THAT
I'M THINKING THE ONLY WAY I CAN GET THROUGH THE DAY IS TO CONTACT A PROSTITUTE TO SEE TONIGHT TO FORCE MY BRAIN TO THINK OF ANOTHER WOMAN WHY DOES LIFE HAVE TO BE THIS WAY FOR ANYONE
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN OVER THERE HAVE YOU'VE BEEN POKING AROUND FOR THE FOR THE BURIED TREASURE
YOU KNOW NOT IN A NAVEL-GAZING WAY BUT IN A
I CALLED MY GRANDMA AND INCOHERENTLY BLUBBERED TO HER ASKING HER TO COME OVER
THE NIGHT AFTER I REALIZED I WAS TRANS I STARTED DRINKING AND TAKING XANAX TWO AT A TIME I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY I TOOK
HE WORKED AT THE SCHOOL
THIS IS FROM THE SHAME AND SECRETS SURVEY
BUT I HAD A WEIRD ON AND OFF CRUSH ON HER THAT MADE THINGS WEIRD IN THE END
HE'S A CLOCK RESTORER LIKE JOHN WAS
I WAS THREE YEARS OLD AT THE TIME AND IT'S THE FIRST MEMORY THAT I CAN REMEMBER FROM CHILDHOOD
THAT'S A FEAR OF MINE
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW BAD THE SEX IS WHEN YOUR EX MIXES IT UP AND BRINGS OUT THE UNPLEASANT PENIS THAT HAS TO BE UNPLEASANT
I'M
WHAT DID YOU SAY
I JUST DECIDED TO INVEST IN REPAIR SO FOR YOU THERE'S NO PROBLEM WITH YOUR HUSBAND BEING AROUND CHILDREN BECAUSE YOU KNOW HE WOULD NEVER
NAW BECAUSE WITH THE BLACKS IT'S SPLINTERED
IF YOU'RE A LEGISLATOR IN A STATE THAT IS IGNORANT ABOUT THIS
UM
THROUGH LIVE TEXTING
THIS CONTINUED UNTIL ONE NIGHT WHEN I DECIDED TO PRETEND TO SLEEP
THAT IS WHAT OUR BRAIN DOES
IF YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT IT'S NOT GONNA GO AWAY
AND ABOUT HAVING DISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY DISORDER IT'S LIKE RUNNING THE WORLD'S LONGEST RELAY RACE WITH A GROUP OF DYSFUNCTIONAL PEOPLE WHO HAVE TROUBLE GETTING ALONG
I MEAN
AND I DON'T FEEL THAT INTENSE SADNESS
TALK ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT FIRST OKAY WELL ACTUALLY LET ME
LET'S GET TO IT HUH
SO
I AM ONE
GIVING EM
THEY REALLY ARE
LEAVE AS A LEGACY
AND THEY
THAT IS A FUCKING T-SHIRT
BECAUSE OF WHAT
SEE AND THEN IT WON'T SEEM SO BAD
HOW YOU CAN HAVE REALLY HORRIFYING MOMENTS WITH PARENTS AND REALLY SWEET MOMENTS WITH THE SAME PARENTS
AND EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THESE GUYS ARE NEVER GETTING OUT OF PRISON AGAIN
THINKING I WAS GOING TO GET YELLED AT OR HIT
THEY APOLOGIZED ON BEHALF OF ALL HUMANITY AND ENGAGED WITH ME AS A HUMAN
UM
I THINK I'VE RAMBLED
BECAUSE I HAVE REALLY BEEN STRUGGLING WITH
I WAS SO BUSY DEALING WITH THE BURDEN OF INCARCERATION THAT MY ANGER JUST HAD TO BE PUSHED TO THE SIDE UNTIL HE CAME HOME
WHO YOU KNOW
THE NEXT DAY INVOLVED MEETING THE OTHERS ON THE FLOOR AND SEEING AN ARRAY OF VARIOUS SERIOUSLY ILL PEOPLE WHO ARE NON-COMMUNICATIVE
AND YOU MIX THAT
I THINK I DO OKAY BEING COMFORTABLE WITH UNRESOLVED PROBLEMS AND FEELING PEACE

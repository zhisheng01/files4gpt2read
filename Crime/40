THANK YOU FOR THAT BECAUSE THAT REALLY DID KIND OF OPEN MY MIND
A HUGE MISTAKE THAT PARENTS CAN MAKE IS TRYING TO BE THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEY HAD WHEN THEY WERE RAISED AND THEN THEY WIND UP SWINGING TOO FAR THE OTHER WAY
I CAN'T WORK UP THE NERVE

AND I WANT TO GROW MY HAIR OUT A LITTLE BIT
SOMEONE THAT WOULD ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND ME AND TALK TO ME ABOUT ANYTHING I COULD GO ON ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME BUT IT'S ALL BASICALLY BEING SO INTIMATE AND TRUSTING OF SOMEONE THAT THE PASSION AND THE LOVE I'D FEEL FOR THEM WOULD BE ITS OWN TURN ON
WHEN I TRIED TO STOP MY ADDICTION AND BE A GOOD HUSBAND
MY DAUGHTER WAS IN A CHRISTMAS PARADE LAST WEEK
AS THE WEEKS GO ON HE KEEPS THE UPDATES COMING

WHENEVER I STRAYED AWAY FROM THESE GUIDELINES HOWEVER I WAS VICIOUSLY CRITICIZED AND MADE OUT TO BE A HORRIBLE PERSON FOR SIMPLY WANTING TO DO THINGS MY WAY
AVOID TALKING TO THEM ABOUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE WEATHER OR THE FOOD IN FRONT OF YOU
AND EVERY THOUGHT CONCLUSION DECISION AND ACTION WAS STRETCHED OUT SO THIN AND LONG THAT IT TAKES ME LIGHT YEARS TO FIND THE END OF IT
THE STUFF THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO
MAYBE A LISTENER OR A FRIEND OF MIND INTERVIEWS ME AND I CAN KIND OF HAVE IT ALL IN ONE EPISODE SO SOMEBODY CAN
IT WASN'T A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE
AND YOU DON'T GET OUT IN THE YARD THERE'S A CEMENT YARD FOR WHEN YOU'RE BEING NAUGHTY
FOOD RUNS MY LIFE AND I BINGE AND PURGE TO GET RID OF STRESS AND FEEL IN CONTROL

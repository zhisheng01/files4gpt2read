UNKEMPT
TO TELL OUR STORIES BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW THE SHAME
SOMETIMES I JUST BOIL OVER I GO THROUGH LONG PERIODS WHERE I AM PEACEFUL AND THEN DIP INTO DIFFICULT TIMES WHERE I JUST CAN'T HANDLE IT
THIS IS ANOTHER VERY CURIOUS EMAIL I GOT FROM A WOMAN WHO CALLS HERSELF TRUDY AND SHE WRITES HI

MYSTIFIES YOU YOUR ENTIRE DAY

ALL OF THE STUFF THAT YOU DESCRIBED IN HERE
MAHA WRITES
WOW
COULD ONLY VIEW WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO FOR A LIVING FROM WHAT STROKED MY EGO THE MOST AND WHAT WOULD BRING ME THE MOST MATERIAL SATISFACTION
BUT I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO HAPPEN THIS SOON
MY MIND IS CONTINUOUSLY RACING THINKING OF SCENARIOS TO DISMANTLE THE NEXT PERSON WHO DECIDES TO QUESTION MY INTELLIGENCE
YOU KNOW WE
I'VE GOTTEN NOWHERE WITH MY HATE-AND-LOVE POLARITY
HONESTLY DON'T KNOW
UM
OBSCURE CALCULATIONS AND THEORIES THAT WERE BEYOND EVEN TOM'S COMPREHENSION BUT WHEN IT CAME TO STUFF THE PROFESSORS WANTED HIM TO FOCUS ON JOHN WAS ALMOST ALLERGIC TO IT
WE USED TO GET ORANGES AND I WOULD TAKE THE ORANGE ZEST AND I WOULD CUT IT UP AND I WOULD LET IT DRY OUT IN THE WINDOWSILL FOR TWO OR THREE WEEKS AND THEN
AND I'M CONFUSED BECAUSE
UM I WOULD HAVE TO CERTAINLY SAY

SENSITIVE MAN AND I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A HUG

THANKS FOR SHARING THAT DAN

I HAD SUCH A GREAT DAY TODAY ACTUALLY YESTERDAY WAS PRETTY GOOD TOO
WHAT THEY SAY IS LIKE
DON'T
YEAH
NOT BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHAT EMOTIONAL PAIN WAS AND WHERE IT CAME FROM AND WHY
IN THE WINTER IN THE MOUNTAINS ABOVE THE TREE LINE
SUNSHINE MAKES ME ANXIOUS NOT ALWAYS BUT ON DAYS WHEN THE WEATHER IS ESPECIALLY SPECTACULAR I FEEL THAT JOLT OF ANXIETY
ALL RIGHT EARLONNE
I CAN'T FUCKING WAIT
THEY'RE SAYING HE'S THE PERSON WHO'S GETTING AWAY WITH SOMETHING

YOU GOT A REALLY GOOD SHOT
AND
GUESS WHAT I DON'T LIKE HER
NON
FOR SOME REASON I JUST HAD THE PICTURE OF ANNIE
WERE THERE ANY COMMENTS OR WAS IT ALL IN YOUR PERCEPTION OF YOURSELF
YOU DESERVE TO FEEL PEACE IN YOUR LIFE
WHO SEEMED TO THINK IT WAS ALL A BIG JOKE
SO FAR SO GOOD RIGHT

FAMILIES VACATIONING ALLEN'S IN HIS FORTY S AN ATHLETIC OUTDOORSY GUY WHO MAKES TIME FOR ME AFTER A FLY FISHING LESSON HE GAVE IN THE MORNING

I MEAN
HOW AWESOME WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN FOR YOU GUYS TO HAVE PUT THAT IN YOUR WEDDING INVITATION OH
AT TEN A M JOHN'S COUSINS FROM FLORIDA HAVE A HEARING SCHEDULED TO REQUEST PERMANENT GUARDIANSHIP OVER JOHN'S MOTHER MARY GRACE
BUT IT ALSO CONTINUES TO HEAL YOURSELF IT DOES YOU CONTINUE TO HEAL YOURSELF WHILE YOU'RE HELPING OTHER PEOPLE
HAVE HAD AN EXPERIENCE THAT DOESN'T HAVE SOMETHING IN IT THAT THEY BEAT THEMSELVES UP ABOUT THAT THEY FEEL IS YOU KNOW IN A GRAY AREA OR ACTUALLY IS IN A GRAY AREA
WHEN THE SONG ENDED WE KEPT SINGING SUBLIME SONGS ALL THE WAY INTO TOWN UNTIL SANTERIA ENDED RIGHT AS WE PARKED TO GO HAVE DINNER TOGETHER IT WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST MOMENTS I'VE EVER HAD
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AND SHE UNDERSTANDS IT'S KIND OF AMAZING
JOHN EVEN SHOWED HIM SOME OF IT ONCE

FUCK YOU BITCH
I AM CONCERNED THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU ON THE RECORDING
ELIJAH'S BEEN INCARCERATED MOST OF HIS LIFE

YOU WILL BEGIN TO
THE FIRST THING I THINK IS THAT THIS GUY IS FEEDING ME SOME BULLSHIT
I DO STILL HAVE THE DIME BY THE WAY
IT WAS SOAP
BUT HE ALSO KNEW JOHN HAD TALKED ABOUT SUICIDE
I THINK JUST THE OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO READ TO WRITE YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT LIFE YOU KNOW FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY YEAR OLD MEN YOU KNOW WHO CAN ACTUALLY TEACH ME SOMETHING
HAVE YOU SHARED THESE THINGS WITH OTHERS
PEOPLE WOULD COME UP AND THANK ME FOR STARTING THE WALK AND SHARE THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE CAUSE BUT THE BEST FEELING
UM MY CAT'S BUTTHOOL NOT HOLE HOOL WRITES
AND THEN WHOOP IT GOES OUT
WHEN I DIVORCED MY HUSBAND I WAS FORCED TO MOVE IN WITH HER AND MY YOUNG DAUGHTER AND IT'S BEEN DEVASTATING FOR MY MENTAL WELL-BEING

THANKS BUDDY
ANY POSITIVE EXPERIENCES WITH YOUR ABUSERS NO SHE'S ALSO BEEN PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY ABUSED
AND
AND THEN FINALLY I'VE GOT A HAPPY MOMENT FILLED OUT BY A WOMAN WHO CALLS HERSELF STILL NOT CREATIVE ENOUGH FOR THIS
I THINK THERE ARE MONSTERS OUT THERE
YOU MIX IT UP UNTIL YOU GET LIKE A PASTE CONSISTENCY AND THEN YOU JUST APPLY IT TO YOUR EYES
I TELL HER I'M SORRY FOR HER LOSS
I LOVE YOU UNTIL I DECIDE TO HATE YOU
THERE'S NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED OTHER GUYS WHO DID TEST POSITIVE BUT HAVE RECOVERED
I DO FEEL LIKE I REALLY I HAVE NOT FOUND MY
MY WEEKDAYS ARE JUST LIKE CRAZY-TRAIN BUSY
SEND
YOU KNOW SO I WAS JUST REALLY GRATEFUL DID IT FEEL LIKE HE WAS
VERY VERY VERY SUSPICIOUS
AND I'D SNUCK DOWNSTAIRS
DROWNING MYSELF IN DIRTY DISHES AND EMPTY CHINESE FOOD CONTAINERS BECAUSE I CAN'T GET OFF THE COUCH WITHOUT EXPERIENCING SEPARATION ANXIETY
HE'D DISMISS YOUR CONCERN

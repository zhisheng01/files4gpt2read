WE EVENTUALLY WANT TO BRING THAT TO THE MAINSTREAM AND AND AH
SHE WAS PRETTY INTELLIGENT CLEAN AND AS I WAS PAYING FOR IT I COULD BE SELFISH MAKE IT ALL ABOUT ME AND SHE WAS GOOD AT MAKING IT A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE FOR ME NOT JUST SEX BUT LISTENING COMMISERATING
WHAT I NEEDED TO DO
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY HEAR WHAT WAS SAID
YOU KNOW AND
FOR HIM AND HIS DAUGHTERS
COULD BE TEARS OF SADNESS
WHAT
I WOULD SAY
THERE WAS A GUY WHO WAS A YOUNG GUY
IT LET ME
I NEED TO FIND A HAIR THAT FEELS LIKE THAT AGAIN
I OFTEN THINK ABOUT CHANGING MY NAME AND MOVING FAR AWAY WHERE NOBODY WOULD KNOW THAT I'M A LOSER
THIS IS A SHAME AND SECRETS SURVEY FILLED OUT BY A WOMAN WHO CALLS HERSELF LI L I
SWISS CHOCOLATE WRAPPED IN A RIBBON
BOTH COMPLETELY AWFUL AND SAD
THAT IT DID NOT GET PASSED
JOHN SUDDENLY BEGAN RECITING PASSAGES FROM THE STORY BACK TO HIM FROM MEMORY ONE FRIEND TOLD ME HOW HIS COWORKERS WOULD TELL HIM NOT TO TALK TO JOHN SO MUCH BECAUSE HE WAS A WEIRDO
NOT READING THE ENTIRETY OF HER LETTER BUT MOST OF IT
IT'S VERY MANLY
I WANT TO THANK HER FOR
NINETY REALLY HIGH
I GUESS IT'S AWFULSOME
TO EVERYDAY COMPULSIVE NEGATIVE THINKING
ANYTHING
I JUST ENJOYED THE COMPANY AND ALSO THE TRUTH IS
MY MOTHER AND MY EX-HUSBAND
SO AS EVERYONE WAS SKATING OFF THE ICE I ASKED THEO
THAT BY DEPRESSION
ALL OF THAT A RENT-CONTROLLED SITUATION
DO NOT
WHICH HAD BEEN HIS LIFE
WE'RE BACK IN OUR CLOSETS
AND SO
SORT OF TAKE ME UNDER THEIR WING AND AND GET ME TO THAT NEXT LEVEL AND THIS PARTICULAR GUY JUST HAPPENED TO BE THE GUY
AN ELASTIC WAISTBAND
WHEN I WAS TWENTY FIVE I WAS RANDOMLY CONTACTED TO ATTEND HIS FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY PARTY
YOU KNOW A MOM LIKE THAT WAS LIKE THE NORMA ARNOLD OF OUR TIME
EVERYTHING IS JUST A MASK I WISH I WAS A REAL PERSON
HOWEVER I'M STILL VERY CHILD-LIKE
I SUPPOSE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO FOCUS
I WOULD JUST SAY AS A KID
SO
YOU KNOW AND
MAYBE I HAD SUCH A
I REALIZED THAT I HAD ESCAPED
UNTIL WE SORT OF HAVE SOME NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR YOU KNOW THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IS WHEN WE REALLY START TO SORT OF WAKE UP AND
TAKING CARE OF ME
HE'S MY BUDDY ALREADY
WITH ANY SORT OF
OR ELSE MAYBE SHE KNOWS I KNOW SO SHE KNOWS SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO SAY IT OUT LOUD ET CETERA ET CETERA ANYWAY
YOU KNOW WE WERE ALWAYS TOLD THAT
IN HER EMAIL
OKAY
AND WHEN I COME BACK TO MARYLAND TO VISIT WOULD I LIKE TO COME AND GIVE BLOOD AND BE PART OF THEIR TEST
UM GOT BACK TOGETHER IN SEVENTH GRADE
THE ONE WHO KNEW JOHN THE LONGEST SINCE HE WAS A TEENAGER WAS TOM MOORE
AND YOU ARE NOT WELCOME CURTIS THEN CURTIS LOOKED FOR HIS MOM
BUT THEN IMAGINE IF I WANTED TO BE A MAN
THAT IS AWFULSOME
STRAIGHT RAISED IN A PRETTY DYSFUNCTIONAL ENVIRONMENT
UM
UM
THE FOUNDATIONS
HE WANTED ME TO GO WITH HIM BUT MUSHA WOULDN'T GIVE ME MY RELEASE AND THANK GOD THEY DIDN'T
ONCE YOUR FISH LINE IS OUT THERE
AND SHE GETS A MASSAGE AT THE SAME TIME
ANY POSITIVE EXPERIENCES WITH YOUR ABUSERS YES AND I STILL HAVEN'T MANAGED TO GET THROUGH ALL MY FEELINGS ON THE ISSUES
IT WAS PROFOUND AND TOTALLY FUCKING AWFULSOME
A JOURNAL IS LIKE
YOU KNOW
CALMED ME DOWN AND JUST STAYED WITH ME ON MY BED
I WAS ELEVEN AND HE WAS THIRTEEN
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE IT WORSE
HOW DO YOU FEEL AFTER WRITING THESE THINGS DOWN NOT MUCH DIFFERENT I'VE COME TO TERMS WITH MY SITUATION AWHILE BACK I'M SURE THINGS WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF I WERE SAYING THIS TO MY FRIENDS AS OPPOSED TO BEING AN ANONYMOUS PERSON DOING A SURVEY
LOOK AT CHILD PORNOGRAPHY
HE SAID A TOTAL OF TWELVE SENTENCES TO ME EVER
WHADDUP NYGE
AND WHEN MY DAD MADE PANCAKES ON SATURDAY MORNINGS
YOU KNOW ARE RUNNING THE COUNTRY
IT'S A CRIME
MY GODSON SAW ME AND CAME RUNNING AT ME LAUGHING WITH HIS GREAT BIG ARMS OPEN FOR A HUG SMILING UP AT HIS GODMOTHER AND SAYING MY NAME FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHEN I WROTE THE BOOK AND AND THAT'S WHEN I FOUND PURPOSE
AND WHEN MY MOTHER CAME OVER IT WAS JUST AFTER THANKSGIVING AND SHE UM SHE SAID
A CULTURAL THING APPARENTLY BUT DID I KNOW WHY HE DIDN'T SUFFER ANY MENTAL ILLNESS
AND I WAS PUTTING MY NERVOUS SYSTEM THROUGH THIS
MORE OF BUT THAT'S ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT
I FEEL LIKE SOMEHOW I HAVE FALLEN INTO THIS TYPE OF
A LOT OF CHANGE IS GONNA HAPPEN
IT GOT UGLY IN HEARING HE WRITES
ENOUGH
AS LONG AS WE TOUCH ONE SOUL IN THE HOUR THAT WE SPEND TOGETHER THAN HEY THIS WAS SO WORTH IT
TRAUMATIZED BATTERED PERSON YOU ARE BE CAREFUL BE AWARE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY
IT'S BEAUTIFUL
ANYTHING ELSE
AND LIKE NOTHING EXCEPT SUBLIME AND BEING MYSELF MATTERED
AND FAYE GAMBLE THE TOWN CLERK
SHE DECIDED TO CALL ME
I'M A MESS I'M TRYING TO GET BETTER
AGGRESSION

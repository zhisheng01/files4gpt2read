YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME IN LIKE A CODED WAY
BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY AFRAID OF EMOTIONAL INTIMACY
SO LOUISE HAY
I WAS LIKE
AND I REALIZED THAT LATER ON
AND AS I WAS DOING THE CATERPILLAR I THOUGHT
THE GAPS IN TIME
THAT'S FANTASTIC
I FEEL FREE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIFTEEN YEARS I LOVE MY BOOBIES BY THE WAY
OF THEIR
YOU KNOW
SADLY I'M NOT A PART OF THAT RIGHT NOW THEY WERE LAST IN TOUCH ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO
UM OK SO KEEPING YOUR TEETH CLEAN IS DIFFERENT IN PRISON AND SO IS GETTING THE WRINKLES OUT OF YOUR CLOTHES
ALL OF THOSE THINGS WHICH MAKE US WHO WE ARE
TOM RISKED GETTING IN TROUBLE AND LET JOHN ACCESS THE LAB WHEN HE WANTED
YOU KNOW
AND IT HAS BEEN FOR YEARS
THIS IS WEEKS AFTER I'D MET RETA AT PROBATE COURT AND SHE DECLINED TO DO AN INTERVIEW A WHOLE SEPARATE TRIP
THEIR POSTURE'S REALLY SLOUCHED AND YOU KNOW AT THE END OF A MEETING
SO YOU COULD STILL SUPPORT HIM HE COULD STILL BE THE FATHER
YOU KNOW AS A CHILD YOU DON'T KNOW THAT SEXUAL ABUSE IS WRONG
LIKE JOHN B
BUT YOU CAN BE OKAY WITHOUT EXPERIENCING JOY AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT THIS PODCAST TO ACCOMPLISH IS TO SAY IT'S OKAY TO HAVE SAD DAYS
AND YOU CAN MAKE AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO MAKE OF THAT
OKAY
AND SAY GODDAMN YOU GILMARTIN
THAT
AND
KIDS ARE WAY MORE INTELLIGENT
WHAT WAS IT LIKE FOR YOU
ALRIGHT COME BACK AND MEET ME AT THIS SPOT BEFORE THE NEXT PERIOD
WELL WHERE WAS ELIJAH THE ENTIRE THREE HOURS WE WERE THERE
AND
EVER BEEN THE VICTIM OF SEXUAL ABUSE SOME STUFF HAPPENED BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT COUNTS
YOU KNOW WHERE WAS THAT ANGER AND PASSION WHEN I WAS A CHILD
IF YOU GOT WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR CHRISTMAS OR WHATEVER AND I SAID I DON'T WANT ANYTHING FROM YOU BUT THIS IS WHAT I WANT I KNOW SHE HAD NOT PAID MY FATHER
THERE'S A LOT OF TOPICS I FEEL LIKE WE NEED
IT'S SO COMPELLING BECAUSE YOU JUST THINK HOW THE FUCK ARE THEY DOING THAT
YOU KNOW ANY OF THAT
IN FACT
HOW DO YOU FEEL AFTER WRITING THESE THINGS DOWN ASHAMED THAT I DON'T HAVE THE WILLPOWER TO MAKE EVEN THE SMALLEST CHANGES REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH THERAPY I HAVE OKAY SO YOU HAVE BEEN TO THERAPY
OR DO GET YOU KNOW
SO
FOR ME HE MADE SUCH AN IMPACT AND THE PEOPLE
HE HAD THIS KNOWING LOOK THAT SAID
AND I WAS LIKE NO ONE DESERVES THAT MANY CHANCES
I LOVE THE SOUND OF PERFECT SILENCE
AND MY ANGER
MAYBE TEN PERCENT OF THE SURVIVORS I'VE TALKED TO
THIS WOULD BE LIKE THIS IS WHO YOU NEED TO CALL AND CONTACT
ABOUT SEXUAL BIAS HAVING ALL OF MY RELATIVES REFER TO MY PAST BOYFRIENDS AS MY FRIEND OR BUDDY
HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MUCH OF THE SUSPICION
YOU CAN BE PATIENT WITH THEM BECAUSE IT'S A PROCESS FOR MANY PEOPLE
NICOLE HAS A BOYFRIEND IN A PRISON IN TEXAS WHERE THEY'VE ACTUALLY EXTENDED THE PHONE HOURS LATE INTO THE NIGHT THAT SOUNDS GOOD RIGHT
I HAVE A PANIC ATTACK ANYTIME I'M IN PUBLIC I NEVER FEEL LIKE MY OLD SELF WHEN I'M OUT IN THE WORLD I HATE WHO I'VE BECOME
AND SHE WRITES
YOU KNOW
YOU KNOW
THAT'S A FIVE PETE
ANY POSITIVE EXPERIENCES WITH THE ABUSERS
BUT THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THEY WERE ALL FRIENDS OF JOHN B MCLEMORE'S
I'M IN OVER MY HEAD AND I CAN'T BREATHE
I FELT LIKE EVERY STAR AND PERSON AND MOLECULE IN THE UNIVERSE WAS RIGHT
AT THE TIME OF THIS RECORDING IT HASN'T AIRED YET
AND I CALLED HER AND I JUST SAID YOU KNOW LOOK
JUST TRY IT
YOU KNOW ANGER AND SADNESS ARE
YOU KNOW RYAN HAD SO MANY SO MUCH LOVE FROM PEOPLE OTHER THAN HIS MOM ABSOLUTELY
IN SEVEN YEARS
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER AND WITH YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HER NOW I KNOW I'M NOT A THERAPIST BUT I
THE WHOLE FIGHT HAD TO DO WITH MY FEELING TAKEN FOR GRANTED AND HIS ADMITTING THAT HE HAS PROMISED HE WOULD DO BETTER ABOUT APPRECIATING ME
IS
ANY COMMENTS TO MAKE THE PODCAST BETTER TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A GUITAR SOLO NOW AND THEN
THERE'S A SPECIFICITY TO EACH ONE BUT I WOULD FEEL COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE GOING TO A TWELVE STEP PROGRAM
AND PLEASE TALK TO SOMEONE ABOUT WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH
SO DID YOUR DAD TELL YOU
WAS THAT YOU JUST YES-AND'ING OR IS THAT THE TRUTH
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T MESS WITH HIM SO MUCH AND SHE CALLED MY FATHER
HAVING CONVERTED SOME TO GOLD
I FELT THAT RUSH OF ADRENALINE GO THROUGH MY BODY
FIFTEEN I LEFT HOME I LEFT HOME AT FIFTEEN OK
JANUARY FIRST
AND HER EPISODE ON THIS PODCAST IS ALL ABOUT EMOTIONAL NEGLECT
WAITING THIS LONG HAS ALLOWED ME TO BE FULLY AWARE OF JUST HOW TREMENDOUSLY HEALING THE ACT OF REPORTING TO AUTHORITIES IS IN AND OF ITSELF
SELF-PARENTING IS HUGE TREAT YOURSELF LIKE THE NEGLECTED WEATHERED
I TURNED AND ASKED IF HE THOUGHT HIS HUSBAND WOULD MIND MY USING HIM AS AN ARMREST
AND THAT MADE IT SEEM AS IF SHE WAS ACTUALLY THERE WITH ME
THE LOOK ON HIS FACE WAS SHEER PANIC AND CONFUSION
FIFTY YEARS TO LIFE
WHICH CAUSED ME TO BE THIS CLASSIC OVERACHIEVER
GAY
THAT DEFINITELY SOUNDS LIKE THIS DUDE WAS GETTIN' OFF ON SOMETHING
IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO REPEAT AS AN ADULT BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT IT'S COMPLETELY NORMAL
AND ANXIOUS
THANK YOU FOR THAT
SQUAT AND COUGH
OR
BUT STARVING YOURSELF ISN'T SOMETHING YOU CAN MAINTAIN
I MEAN WHO KNOWS BUT THAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE TYPE OF MONEY THAT COULD POTENTIALLY AMASS TO A BOUNTIFUL HIDDEN TREASURE
AND EVEN IN THE TRAILER

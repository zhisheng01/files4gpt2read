AND RELATIONSHIP RIGHT
AND
UM AND LEARN HOW TO LESSEN THE AMOUNT OF TIMES THAT SHIT PRESENTS ITSELF
WHEN THEY MISS YOU'RE PUTTING MORE ENERGY INTO IT AND IT SWINGS AROUND IT'S LESS EXHAUSTING TO HIT HIM
THAT'S WHAT MY DAD WAS
I WAS ON THE VERGE OF A MENTAL BREAKDOWN I CALLED THE SUICIDE HOTLINE AND THE GOOD PEOPLE THERE WERE ABLE TO HELP CALM ME DOWN A BIT
WHO NEVER MET JOHN IN PERSON
SHE'S GAY
EVER BEEN PHYSICALLY OR EMOTIONALLY ABUSED
I'M NEVER GOING TO TRANSITION SUCCESSFULLY
HALF YOUR AGE
AS THE WEEK WENT ON IT WAS THE SAME
PUKING IN A BAG SO THAT NO ONE WILL HEAR SEE OR FIND THE EVIDENCE
BUT THE EMOTIONAL TOLL
THEY GAVE ME BIBLICAL TIME
I ONLY THINK VIOLENT THINGS LIKE KILLING BEATING IMPALING OR FEEDING THEM TO THINGS DURING SEXUAL ACTS I HATE THESE THOUGHTS I WISH I COULD HAVE THE NICE THOUGHTS ABOUT REGULAR GIRLS
I FEEL LIKE SCUM
YOU KNOW AND THE STORIES SHE TELLS EVEN MY BROTHERS CHALLENGED HER ON SOME THINGS
BUT WAS ALSO ABLE TO STAY PRESENT AND REALIZE I WAS SAFE BECAUSE OF THE SHOCKING EFFECT OF THE ICE I FELT PROUD OF MYSELF FOR UTILIZING THIS SKILL AND PRACTICING SELF CARE
THIS IS AN EMAIL I GOT FROM AH
THIS IS AN AWFULSOME MOMENT FILLED OUT BY ELSIE B
I WAS BARELY HALFWAY ACROSS WHEN I STARTED GETTING VERTIGO AND ONE OF MY WONDERFUL PANIC ATTACKS HIT ME
ON THE FIRST DAY I WAS FIFTEEN
ACTUALLY BOTH HER PARENTS WERE DRINKERS BUT
OR HOW MANY TIMES I'VE BEEN DRIVING AND THOUGHT ABOUT DRIVING OFF THE ROAD BUT NOT DOING IT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HURT ANYONE ELSE
RETA THE COUSIN
STRAIGHTFORWARD LINE THAT'S NEVER CONFUSING
YOU CAN MAKE A ONE-TIME PAYPAL DONATION
AND COULD HAVE RAIDED THE FREEZER
I WAS AT FACE LEVEL WITH MY DAD'S JUNK
AND I REMEMBER BECAUSE THERE WAS SNOW ON THE GROUND
AND ALSO WHAT AN ESCAPEMENT IS THE MECHANISM INSIDE A CLOCK OR A WATCH THAT ACTUALLY DOES THE TICKING MANY OF THESE HOROLOGIST AND CLOCK COLLECTORS TOLD ME HOW THEY HAD BECOME FASCINATED WITH CLOCKS AS CHILDREN
WE HAD ORANGE ACNE ZEST BARS ORANGE CRANBERRY BAR
YOU KNOW
I WAS JUST
SHE'S IN HER TWENTIES SHE WAS RAISED IN A PRETTY DYSFUNCTIONAL ENVIRONMENT SHE WAS THE VICTIM OF SEXUAL ABUSE AND NEVER REPORTED IT
AND AH
I'M EARLONNE WOODS
YOU KNOW
WHAT IF ANYTHING DO YOU WISH FOR THE ABILITY TO LET MYSELF BE LESS CYNICAL AND DISTRUSTING OF PEOPLE I WISH FOR COMFORT IN MY OWN BODY I WISH FOR FRIENDS THAT WOULD THROW ME A SURPRISE BIRTHDAY PARTY INSTEAD OF DITCH ME
AND THEN THIS SNAPSHOT FROM HER LIFE
IN HIS THIRTY S AND HE WRITES LATE ONE NIGHT I CALLED MY PSYCHIATRIST TO MAKE THE CALL I HAD TO TAKE THE LOADED GUN AWAY FROM MY HEAD AND REPLACE IT WITH THE PHONE
HAVE YOU SHARED THESE THINGS WITH OTHERS YES IT WENT FINE HOW DO YOU FEEL AFTER WRITING THESE THINGS DOWN OK
THEY'RE RESPONSIBILITY FARMED OR HARVESTED
AND SHE WRITES
THE PARK WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THE WAY THE OLD TREES ARE IN LATE SUMMER THE WEATHER WAS WARM AND IT FELT GOOD TO WALK ALL BY MYSELF AND I WALKED PAST THE BENCH WHERE WE KISSED LAST SUMMER AND SEEING THAT PLACE DIDN'T HURT SO BAD ANYMORE
YOU KNOW OTHER PEOPLE AND AH AND SO THAT BECAME MY OBSESSION
I FELT FREE
IN A TIME AND PLACE WHERE YOU CAN'T BLAME THEM
I WAS GOOD IN SECOND GRADE
AND I THREW THE MIC DOWN AND I STARTED BREAKDANCING
WHEN ARNOLD'S CHARACTER EVALUATES A BLOOD STAIN LEFT BY THE PREDATOR AND CONCLUDES THAT HIS TEAM COULD IN FACT KILL THE BEAST
IMAGINE THE MOST DISAPPOINTING NEWS YOU'VE EVER GOTTEN AND NOW IMAGINE YOU HAVE TO HEAR IT EVERY DAY WHEN YOU WAKE UP
SHE SAID WHY DID YOU BAIL HIM OUT WHY DID YOU DO THAT
THERE'S MY FAVORITE CATEGORY WHICH IS YOU CAN'T SEE IT
I JUST WANT TO BE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
WHO SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION
AND WHAT HELPS HER IS SINGING
MY MOTHER DIVORCES MY DAD AT AGE FOUR
AND THEN THERE'S A WOMAN
I NEED TO EAT THE THREE OF YOU AND THEN TAKE OVER YOUR CROWN SO TRY NOT TO KICK ON THE WAY DOWN
FOR THE GOLD OR THE CASH OR WHATEVER THERE IS
AND HERE'S ANOTHER THING THAT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU SHARE
MORE AGITATED
AND I'M NOT TRYING TO SAY THAT THOSE BUTTONS AREN'T REAL AND VALID AND THOSE ARE ALSO MY OWN BUTTONS AS A MOTHER AND A FEMINIST
HUT
I EXPERIENCED SO MUCH LESS ABUSE THAN HE DID AND I AM FEELING SO BROKEN AND STUCK
I THINK DBT DIALECTICAL BEHAVIORAL THERAPY WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO HELP GET
I HAD A HABIT OF PILING ALL MY TEXTBOOKS IN MY BACKPACK AND PUTTING IT ON MY BODY TO EASE NUMBNESS AND ANXIETY THAT WOULD GO AWAY IF I PUT SOMETHING HEAVY ON ME
IT WAS REALLY HARD TO PROCESS EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON BECAUSE I WAS HAVING A REALLY BAD TRIP
I ACTUALLY I HAD THAT
ANY COMMENTS THAT MAKE THE PODCAST BETTER MORE EPISODES LIKE THE LADY WHO WAS IN THE BELGIAN CHILD SEX RING I LIKE HEARING THE REALLY DARK AND FUCKED UP STORIES
OH NO I'M FINE WITH IT
IT MAKES IT REALLY HARD TO SEPARATE THE ABUSE AND THE LOVE
PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE INSOMNIA IF THEY HAD CONTROL OVER IT SO
WHO AH WRITES LET'S SEE
I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE YOU KNOW IF YOU HAD THE FLU
SO ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE SUICIDE AND SELF-HARM AND SEXUALITY HONESTY PUTS YOU IN JEOPARDY
JUST REALLY NOT BEING AFRAID TO DIE
SURVIVORS UNDERSTAND THAT
HE'S HAD A FEW STINTS IN PRISON FOR OTHER CRIMES AND WE'LL GET INTO THAT LATER LIKE THE OTHER PEOPLE YOU'LL HEAR FROM IN THIS EPISODE
THANKFULLY I GOT RID OF THEM AND I'M NOW DATING SOMEONE WHO'S NOTHING BUT SUPPORTIVE AND KIND AND DOESN'T HAVE A PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE BONE IN HIS BODY
HIGHLY ACTIVE SEX DRIVE
YOU KNOW DO WE SHAME OURSELVES OR OTHERS WHEN WE HAVE THE FLU BUT FOR SOME REASON
I'M ON A PODCAST
UM SO AT LEAST THAT PARTS REFRESHING
AND THAT WAS MY EXPERIENCE IN SUPPORT GROUPS AND IT CHANGED MY LIFE
IT WAS WRONG LIKE WEIRD WRONG
IT'S NOT THE MOST NORMAL SEQUENCE OF EVENTS
CLEARLY HE WASN'T CALLED
I'M JUST NOT GOING TO PICK UP A KNIFE AND GO STAB SOMEBODY
I SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT
BUT
I LIKE IT GET THAT IN THE KAMA SUTRA
SO
GET THIS EPISODE
BUT AT THE FIRST INSTANCE OF A CHALLENGE BE IT AN ASSIGNMENT OR SOMETHING SOCIAL
THERE WITH ME DURING THOSE LONELY HOURS IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST FEELINGS AFTER KNOWING WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SPEND THAT TIME ALONE
THAT I HAVEN'T HAD ONE PERSON
ANY IDEAS TO MAKE THE

UM
BUT THAT IS PROFOUND
I LAUGHED ALL THE WAY HOME
JOHN WAS NOT BUSHY RED HAIR
WHEN THE TIME COMES IF YOU CHOOSE TO CONFRONT YOUR FAMILY
HE ALSO HAS TO DEAL WITH MY MENTAL FOG
SO IT WAS KINDA LIKE
JOHN KERRY WAS HIS OPPONENT
I REALLY HOPE FOR YOU THAT YOU CAN FIND YOUR PEOPLE WHEN YOU'RE ABLE TO MOVE OUT OF YOUR HOUSE AND FIND THE LOVE AND ACCEPTANCE THAT IS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD
CAUSE THAT IS EVERY BIT AS BAD AS PUNCHING YOUR KID RIGHT IN THE FUCKING FACE ACTUALLY PROBABLY WORSE
THE CHILDHOOD STUFF
BE IN THE MOMENT AND LIVE SIMPLY
TILTED HER HEAD TO THE SIDE AND INTONED
WHICH IS A FEAR OF SADNESS
HE'S LIKE SIT DOWN
THAT YOU'LL ALWAYS BE FIGHTING IT
AH MAY NOT POSSESS THE VOCABULARY TO EXPLAIN IT BUT YOUR FEELINGS ARE THERE AND YOU KNOW AND I KNEW FROM JUMP THAT MY MOTHER JUST WASN'T A GOOD PERSON AND MY FATHER WAS
SO WAS THAT LIKE
YOU WILL LEAVE YEAH EXACTLY
WELL WE ARE SENDING YOU SOME LOVE
DISGUST WITH THE WAY PREGNANCY HORMONES MADE ME FEEL AND WITH THE VERY SMELL OF FOOD
PERHAPS YOU COULD CONSIDER THE TERM ASSIGNED GENDER AT BIRTH
I'M ASSUMING THAT
IT'S A LIST JOHN WROTE ON A SHEET OF YELLOW NOTEBOOK PAPER TITLED AT THE TOP PEOPLE TO CONTACT
SO GOOD
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH SOMEONE WHO SHARES YOUR THOUGHTS OR EXPERIENCES
HAVING MET THEO EVER SINCE I MET HIM
I'M POOPIN'
IS THAT SOMEBODY WHO WAS RAISED IN THAT KIND OF ABUSE
EMAIL ME
YOU'RE HAVING TO HIDE YOUR SEXUALITY
SHE HAS NO CLUE I'M LIKE THIS AND WE DATED FOR FOUR MONTHS
YOU NEED HELP
ANYWAY I'VE MADE PLANS TO GO OUT IN PUBLIC FOR THE FIRST TIME AS FEMALE SO WE'LL SEE HOW THAT GOES
YOU'RE JUST
SO THAT BONDED US IMMEDIATELY
IF THAT CUNT
WHEN I WAS AROUND EIGHT I SAW HIM WATCHING ME UNDRESS AFTER TAKING A SHOWER THROUGH THE DOOR OF MY BEDROOM
WE MET DELL IN OUR OUTSIDE STUDIO THEY GAVE MY HUSBAND THE OPPORTUNITY TO TELL ME
AND I WAS LIKE AND I HATED TO MISS SCHOOL I I WAS I WAS A B STUDENT I WASN'T A STRAIGHT A STUDENT BUT I JUST FUCKING HATED MAKEUP WORK
AND THE LITTLE THING DIDN'T EVEN SQUIRM LET ALONE TRY TO PECK ME AS I FEARED HE SHE IT
HOW CAN I BECOME A PERSON WITH MORE INTEGRITY AND MORE LOVING AND COMPASSIONATE AND OPEN
YOU KNOW
DON'T EVER SAY THAT TO SOMEONE ESPECIALLY YOUR KID
I
SO PLEASE DON'T INTERPRET THIS AS ME TELLING YOU THAT YOU'RE A BAD MOTHER
DARKEST SECRETS
I WOKE UP TWO DAYS LATER WITH THE WORST HANGOVER
KNOWING THAT OTHER PEOPLE WERE COPING DIFFERENTLY
YOU CAN DO MANY WAYS YOU CAN TAKE A MAGAZINE THAT HAS A HIGH CONTENT OF PIGMENT ON THE PAPER AND YOU CAN JUST SHAVE THE COLORS OFF THE PAPER
WERE PROBABLY RAISED
HE WOULD FORCIBLY HOLD ME DOWN WHILE FONDLING MY GENITALS
IT'S THAT SIMPLE YOU KNOW
SHE'LL HAVE CONTROL OVER THE MCLEMORE PROPERTY AND EVERYTHING ON IT
WHAT IN THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING
IT WAS A FLEDGLING TUFTED TITMOUSE
AND HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF
I JUST DON'T EVEN WANT TO SAY SO BECAUSE IT'S IT'S LIKE THAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE JUST TELLING THEM A BORING STORY
A BUNCH OF BOTTLES
AND
SHE IS GAY
AND YOU'RE PROM QUEEN
FROM THAT CHILDHOOD TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE AND
IN BRINGING A CONVERSATION TO ANOTHER LEVEL TO ANOTHER LEVEL TO ANOTHER LEVEL IS IS THAT
DESCRIBE IN YOUR BODY AND IN YOUR MIND
AND MERCURIAL
I TELL HER I DON'T THINK THAT'S ALL THAT STRANGE
YOU KNOW I CALL IT YOU KNOW A REVEAL SO TO SPEAK YOU KNOW
THAT I'M ACTUALLY GONNA GET A PHONE CALL
THAT'S WHY ALL THOSE GUYS ARE IN PRISON
IN CALGARY
UM
SCATTER-BRAINED TOTALLY LOST IT
I FELT LIKE A DICK BUT DEEP DOWN I KNEW IT HAD TO BE DONE AND IT PAID OFF
AND
SO I WAS PRETTY SURE
YOU KNOW
ANYWAY
AND THEN ALSO WOMEN'S BOXING DOESN'T GET THE ATTENTION THAT MIXED MARTIAL ARTS DOES FOR SOME REASON THEY WON'T EVEN TELEVISE THE WOMEN
WATCHED LAST NIGHT AND WAS JUST
REALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO
SURE THERE'S STILL NARCISSISM
I COULDN'T
I HOPE YOU CAN GET THE COURAGE
THIS OFTEN LEADS TO THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE ALTHOUGH I WOULD NEVER ACT ON IT FOR THE FEAR THAT MY NIECES WOULD BE MENTALLY HARMED
ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S WHAT THEY USED TO DO IN THE
HOW MANY FEEL VIOLATED
THEY SAID LET ME TRY ONE MORE THING ON YOU AND AFTER MY LAST VISIT
THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT
THAT I HAVE BEEN LABELED
I THINK I'LL BE ABLE TO LET MY FRIENDS KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THEY ARE TO ME IN THE NEAR FUTURE I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL EVER BE ABLE TO LET MY PARENTS KNOW THAT I'D RATHER NOT SPEND TIME WITH THEM
SHE COULDN'T FIND JOHN'S MOTHER'S PURSE OR A CHECKBOOK OR JOHN'S LAPTOP
THOUGH JUST A LITTLE BIT TO THE SIDE OF THE MAZE
UM
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO JUST
AND I STARTED CRYING EVEN HARDER BUT NOW OUT OF HAPPINESS
YOU KNOW CHANGES IN OUR LIFE AND
I THINK SHE MEANS IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A HORRIBLE EXCEPT THE BIGGER PAIR WAS FALLING OFF
I SAT THERE SPEECHLESS AND BLUSHING WITH SHAME FOR SO BLATANTLY MOCKING A FRIEND OF HERS
WOW

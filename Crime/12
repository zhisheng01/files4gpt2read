ON JUNE TENTH
THAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL
AND GO
ABOUT HER ANXIETY SOCIAL ANXIETY
VICTIMS PERPETRATORS
SPILL YOUR DRINK BUTTHOLE
WHAT THE
HAS TO BE APPROVED BY THIS GUY HERE
THE COMPASSION IS ALWAYS THE KEY
ALMOST CHILD-LIKE
I WAS STARVING AND ALL I WANTED WAS A PEANUT BUTTER SANDWICH THE WAY THAT MY FATHER MADE THEM
MEANING
NOBODY SEES ME AND WANTS TO HELP
AND THEN IT HAPPENED IT WENT ON FOR ALMOST A YEAR
MY MOTHER WAS AN ALCOHOLIC I REMEMBER WAKING UP ONE TIME TO A HARD SLAP ON THE BACK SHE WAS TRYING TO PROVOKE MY DAD INTO HITTING HER AND GIVING HER A REASON TO CALL THE COPS ON HIM
YOU KNOW
PERHAPS THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO DIE IN THE FIRST PLACE
AND WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM
THE GRIEF NEED IS MAKING ME A LITTLE NUTS
GUESS IT JUST TAKES A LOT OF PRACTICE
YOU KNOW
BUT IT'S LEFT THERE
IT TOLD ME THAT MY FATHER WAS
SO
FUCKING HORRIFYING CAN SOMETIMES NOT
UM
HAPPY I WAS THERE
AS OUTSIDE THE SKY TURNED DARK
WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER
MAKE UP WHO THIS
HIS FRIENDS HAD GOTTEN DIFFERENT BITS OF INFORMATION OVER THE YEARS
A PLACE TO LIVE WITH A YARD SO I CAN GET A DOG
I TOLD A FRIEND OR TWO ABOUT HER ONCE I WAS AN ADULT BUT NEVER AS A KID OR TEEN
WHAT'S REALLY COMMON ABOUT VICTOR WALK AND THE VICTOR WALK DOCUMENTARY IS THAT
SEEKING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
AS SOMEONE WHO SUFFERED FROM POST-PARTUM ANXIETY AND STILL HAS AMBIVALENT FEELINGS ABOUT MOTHERHOOD
EMETOPHOBIA WHICH IS A GREAT FEAR OF VOMIT
CHECK OUT THE NEXT EPISODE OF THE SPORKFUL
JUST MY TWO SENSE ANYWAY
YOU'LL FORGET ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS
AND THIS IS THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS I WANTED TO READ THIS SURVEY
LAUGH IT OFF
WHICH IS CERTAINLY HARD BUT THAT'S MY TWO CENTS
IT'S A MENTAL BLANK SPOT IT'S LIKE
THAT'S THE DAMAGE THEY DO
I MOVED INTO THEIR HOME TO TAKE CARE OF THEM FOR THE LAST MONTH OF EACH OF THEIR LIVES
WE'VE BEEN HAVING PEOPLE CANCEL THEIR MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTIONS
COME OUTSIDE TO THE PARKING LOT AFTER THE GAME I'LL KILL YOU
WE WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT FIRST WE ASKED FAMILIES OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE TO WRITE US AND LET US KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
THE FIRST TIME YOU FROZE
BUT HERE I WAS
FROM ANYBODY
WHEN I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE RETIRED BECAUSE
I THEN BARKED ONCE AND SPRINTED BACK TO THE SAFETY OF MY AUNT'S HOME
OH AND THEN SHE SENT ME A QUOTE
THIS NEXT SURVEY IS
THIS IS FROM THE SHAME AND SECRETS SURVEY
TYLER ESTIMATES THE TOTAL VALUE FOR ALL OF HIS STUFF CONSERVATIVELY AT MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS
IF YOU DO DO THAT
AND THE GENERAL MANAGER SO HE WAS LIKE
NOT REALIZING THAT WAS THE LAST SURVEY
THAT'S WHERE THE SHAME GOT ATTACHED TO THIS GUILT RESENTMENT ANGER YOU KNOW ALL OF THESE THINGS AND AND AH
I MEAN GENUINELY I HAD NO IDEA THAT WHAT I WAS DOING WAS A CRIME I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT LAW OR CRIME OR SO YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE IN A SAFE SPACE TO TALK TO SOMEONE ABOUT IT I DID
CHARACTER UM
I GET IT
THAT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN
I KNOW THEY WILL JUST FOLLOW ME IF I DON'T WORK THEM OUT HERE
OR
TAKE A SHIT
IT'S UP TO EACH PRISONER TO FIND THEIR OWN REASONS TO KEEP GOING
SIMPLY GETTING OUT OF BED AND FACING THE WORLD EACH DAY WAS A MONUMENTAL TASK
UM
I HAVE VERY FEW MEMORIES OF THE EARLY ONE AH
COMING TO THAT THAT CONCLUSION
AND MY TWO BROTHERS WENT
YOU KNOW IPHONES ARE
I HAVE DECIDED I'VE HAD ENOUGH
ANOTHER BOYFRIEND TOLD ME TO ONLY CONTACT HIM WHEN I HAD HAPPY THINGS TO TELL HIM AFTER I CONFIDED THAT I WAS VERY DEPRESSED AND LONELY
JUST NO NOTHING IN PARTICULAR JUST THAT YOU KNOW
SEEING IT
AND FOR SOME REASON
MY NEXT DOPAMINE RELEASE
NICOLA BUCCI HAS BEEN IN SAN QUENTIN FOR FOUR YEARS YEP
YOU KNOW OUR LIVES ARE VERY VERY BUSY AND WE'RE ALL DOING DIFFERENT THINGS AND SO IT'S NICE TO GET TOGETHER AND YOU KNOW JUST HANG OUT
ARE THE
IT STILL HAPPENS
HISPANICS AND OTHERS
YOU DESERVE TO TALK TO SOMEBODY
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU IS REAL AND VALID AND UM
MOST FULFILLING HUGS I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED
I'M WALKING TO THE ELEVATOR TO GO UP TO MY ROOM WHEN WHO SHOULD POP OUT OF THE STAIRWELL BUT JOHN'S COUSIN RETA
I LIKE IT A LOT
WHAT WHAT WAS IT LIKE UM SO THREE KIDS TOTAL THREE KIDS TOTAL THREE BOYS
AND UM
BOTH CHEMICALLY IMBALANCED
TO THE COMMUNITY INSIDE OF SAN QUENTIN
MY ETERNAL IS STRONGER THAN MY INTERNAL MOST OF THE TIME
THE SATISFACTION OF SELF CARE
THERE'S NO ONE GANG LEADER THAT RUNS EVERYTHING
BUT I HAVEN'T STARTED ANY OF EM

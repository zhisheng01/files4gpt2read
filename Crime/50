YOU
AND THEN I WANTED TO READ
AND DO I EVEN EXIST
AND HOW EVEN AT AGE FIFTY SEVEN OR EIGHTY
IT'S FUCKED
I ASKED
THOUGH THEIR SICKNESS IS LESS DANGEROUS AND DRAMATIC THAN HIS THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO AREN'T HOLDING HIM ACCOUNTABLE ARE DEALING WITH THEIR OWN SICKNESS OF CO-DEPENDENCY
I FELT LIKE I WAS HOME
SO
YOU KNOW I THOUGHT SOMEWHERE IN THIS YOU KNOW PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN BEING DIVORCED AND BEING ALMOST REMARRIED
OF HOCKEY AND YOU KNOW THE
I DID IT
AND IN SUPPORT GROUPS
UM
YOU KNOW AND HE'S FREAKING OUT SHE'S ON HER BACK SHE'S GASPING FOR BREATH
ONCE I EXPRESSED IT TO HIM OVER THE PHONE AND HE DIDN'T CALL ME FOR A FEW DAYS
WAITING FOR THE JUDGE TO CALL THEM BACK TO HIS CHAMBERS
EVEN ONE OF THE UNRESPONSIVE PATIENTS SAT WITH US AND PUT PIECES IN
I PAY RENT
THAT'S AGAINST NATURE
BECAUSE FROM THAT POINT FORWARD
ABOUT HER ANXIETY
FROM DR
THAT THAT WAS
SHE'S AH BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND NINETEEN ABOUT HER DEPRESSION TURNING THE KEY OVER AND OVER AND OVER LIKE MAYBE THIS TIME THE BATTERY WON'T BE DEAD AND THE CAR WILL START
CURIOUS
THEY'VE GOT A PERSONALITY AND THE CRAZY PART IS HE WALKS AROUND WITH THEM ALL THE TIME
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU BEAT YOURSELF UP FOR NAPPING
SO LIKE
SO FILL OUT A SURVEY IT'S TOTALLY ANONYMOUS
AND SHE WRITES A FEW YEARS AGO MY DAD HAD A STROKE IT AFFECTED HIS SPEECH COGNITIVE ABILITIES AND BALANCE AND WALKING HE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO SKI
AMY ON THE WALL WRITES
WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN APPROACHED AS A FOUNDATION TO
LET ME SEE
I FEEL LIKE I DON'T DESERVE THAT SORT OF PRAISE GIVEN THE RELATIVELY MINOR NATURE OF MY PROBLEMS I FREQUENTLY FEEL LIKE I'M JUST AN ATTENTION SEEKER
AND THEN WE STAND THERE
THE EMPEROR HAD LOST HIS CLOTHES
HE INSISTS ON THIS
IT MAKES A PERSON FEEL GOOD
YES THAT RIGHT THERE IS SEXUAL ABUSE
NO ADDICTION NO SUBSTANCE ABUSE NO
SO IN THAT MOMENT YOU WANT TO LAY IN BED THAT'S THE MOMENT
WE JUST STOOD THERE FOR PROBABLY HALF HOUR
AND I WOULD BASICALLY
OTHER TIMES I'VE HAD FANTASIES OF BEING DOMINATED BY THE OPPOSITE SEX
WHAT GUIDED ME
IS GOING TO ITUNES GIVING US A GOOD RATING
THIS IS A HAPPY MOMENT FILLED OUT BY A WOMAN WHO CALLS HERSELF WREN
I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO BORROW MONEY FROM MY PARENTS TO PAY MY BILLS
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT I CAN TELL ALLEN IS BEING PURPOSELY VAGUE HERE
PLEASE TAKE A VIDEO AND UPLOAD IT
BUT WE ALL START SOMEWHERE
REACT DIFFERENTLY TO LIFE AND NOT ASSUME THAT EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OVERWHELMING DISAPPOINTING
AND
KIND OF MY LIFE'S WORK
I BELIEVE OTHERS CALLED HIM THE DANCING MONKEY BECAUSE HE KNEW HOW TO ENTERTAIN THE EXECUTIVES WHICH IS WHY HE SHOT UP THE LADDER WITHOUT ACTUALLY DOING ANY GOOD WORK HIMSELF
IT WAS JUST A NORMAL DAY THE SAME THING THAT WE ALWAYS DO YOU KNOW WE GO IN
TO HEAR THAT
BRAVE AND KIND HEARTED
GIVE HER INCREASING CONSEQUENCES FIRST TIME
THE FEAR OF ABANDONMENT IS JUST TOO GREAT
TO BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF ME
JOHN DOES NOT HAVE A HIGH OPINION OF MODERN HUMANITY'S ABILITY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS
YOU HAVE A PART IN YOU BEING IN DEBT BECAUSE YOU LENT HER THAT MONEY
WHICH AT FIRST I THOUGHT WAS PRETTY REMARKABLE
I HOPE I HELPED HER AS WELL
SHE SEEMS OK WITH IT AND SAYS SURE AFTER THE HEARING WE CAN GO SOMEWHERE AND TALK
PULLED UP MY SHORTS AND SAID MATTER-OF-FACTLY
THE IDEA OF PROP SIXTY SIX WAS TO REFORM THE CALIFORNIA THREE-STRIKES LAW
I THINK IT WOULD SHOW PEOPLE THAT IT'S OK IF THEY HAD ALRIGHT UPBRINGINGS BUT ARE STILL STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH THAT DISCUSSION POINT OF GIVING YOURSELF PERMISSION TO FEEL MESSED UP EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE SOMETHING HORRIBLE HAPPEN TO YOU
NOT THAT THE TRAUMA WASN'T ALREADY DONE BY WHAT THAT FUCKING GUY DID
BUT NOW I WOULD BE IN THE POSITION OF POWER IT MAKES ME SAD AND HOPELESS FOR MY FUTURE OH BUDDY DON'T
I HONESTLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE LAUGHED ABOUT MAYBE IT WAS THE ALCOHOL BUZZ OR SOME OF OUR SURROUNDINGS BUT IT WAS AN HOUR OR TWO I WILL NEVER FORGET
POSITIVE THAT THE IMAGE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT OF TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW IS THE TRUTH OF HOW IT'S GOING TO BE
LET'S BE HONEST
WHERE SUPPOSEDLY ROACHES ROAMED
UM AND THEN WHEN MY FATHER DIED I DID START QUESTIONING IT AND THEN WHEN MY MOTHER THREW US IN THE STREET HIS MOM MY GRANDMOTHER TOOK US IN WHICH TAKES US BACK TO THE ROW HOME
SOMEONE FROM HER WORK BROUGHT HER
ABANDONMENT AND NEGLECT
HE DOESN'T HAVE JOHN ANYMORE TO EMPLOY HIM AND NOW HE CAN'T EVEN DRUM UP ODD JOBS HE SAYS BECAUSE HE CAN'T GET TO HIS TOOLS HIS LAWNMOWER AND HIS WELDER AND HIS MASONRY STUFF
AND YOU ARE WHO YOU WERE BORN TO BE
EVERY SINGLE DAY
SO MORE THAN ANYTHING I JUST FEEL CONFUSED AND ASHAMED
AH WHY WERE YOU HOSPITALIZED
ALL OF US WHO'VE BEEN AROUND VICTOR WALK FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS
AND
YOU KNOW HE STARTED TALKING TO ME AND ASKING ME YOU KNOW
NO THEY WOULD JUST SAY YOU GOTTA MOVE LIKE THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT HER PAST I KNOW THAT SHE DID NOT HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH HER MOTHER WHO I WAS ALSO CLOSE WITH BUT NOT AS CLOSE AS MY FATHER'S MOTHER
BUT WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO
SHE WATCHED ME A LOT AFTER THAT BUT NEVER GAVE ME ANY AFFECTION OR TRIED TO UNDERSTAND SO I QUIT BASICALLY COLD TURKEY
WE CHAT FOR A BIT THOUGH AND BEFORE SHE GOES OUT THE DOOR
IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOR FROM CHILDHOOD
UM
SEX OFFENDERS
UNQUOTE
THE KIND I HAVEN'T GOTTEN A LOT OF LATELY AND IT WAS SO WORTH IT
YOUR EXPERIENCE IN BOXING
HIS COUSIN FROM FLORIDA RETA LAWRENCE IS ON THERE
DEREK CAN COME IF HE WANTS I DO NOT WANT RYAN

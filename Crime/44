ASIDE FROM THE BOREDOM SHE WORRIES ABOUT HIM LOSING A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY HE GETS FROM THAT JOB THAT HE COULD SPEND IN A COMMISSARY YEAH AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WROTE ABOUT THE LACK OF CLEANING SUPPLIES BUT OF COURSE FOLKS IN PRISON ARE FINDING A WORK AROUND PRISON INGENUITY RIGHT
HIS DEAD HUSBAND'S ASHES IN A BOX IN THE MIDDLE SEAT BETWEEN US
WHAT YOU SEE
ISSUES HER ANXIETY AND CODEPENDENCY AND SHE WRITES RECENTLY HAD ONE OF THE MOST INTENSE FLASHBACKS I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED I FELT SOME OF THE SAME PAINFUL BODILY SENSATIONS THAT OCCURRED DURING MY SEXUAL ASSAULT
SO THERE WASN'T REALLY ANYTHING THAT THE HOSPITAL SERVED THAT I COULD EAT
YOU KNOW TO
AND THAT BEHAVIOR
YOU KNOW I HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE AMAZING WOMAN WHO
WHY ARE DRUG OFFENDERS WORTH SAVING
I THINK A WORSE PROBLEM IS SORT OF COMFORT IN MY OWN SKIN IF THAT MAKES SENSE
SEE THE TRUTH OF WHAT IT REALLY IS AND FEEL IT
YOU KNOW WENT BACK TO MY

YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT THIS ANYMORE I CAN DO LIFE BY MYSELF LIKE WAY HARDER TRANSITION THAN I EVER IN A MILLION YEARS EXPECTED WAY HARDER TIME IN THERE
SO INSTEAD OF HOT FOOD IT'S CRACKERS BREAD
JUST SAD
AND SHE WRITES
AH AND THEN
SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS STUFF CAN HAPPEN
AND IF YOU FIND YOURSELF UNABLE
TO ME HEARING THAT IS THE ULTIMATE CONFU CAUSE THAT'S THAT'S MOMMY THAT'S SO SEXUALLY CAUGHT LIKE HOW DO YOU

JAMMING THE FUCK OUT TO A CASSETTE FULL OF TUBA MUSIC

SO HE'S ON HE AND I ARE ON THE SAME PAGE WHEN IT COMES TO THAT
I TRY TO TELL MYSELF THAT
JUST REALLY
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY I FEEL CLOSER TO THEM THAN I DO TO MALE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE
UM
LIKE A STAPLE OR A PAPER CLIP
WAS SIMPLY AWFUL-SOME
THANK YOU FOR THAT
BUT
I DARE YOU
IT JUST REALLY REALLY TOUCHES ME THAT YOU
MAYBE IT'S A MILD CONSEQUENCE
HE'S AH EIGHTEEN EITHER EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN
I'M BRIAN REED NICE TO MEET YOU
JUST TRY IT JUST SAY FOR THIS YEAR
LET'S GO BACK TO THE YARD AND TALK TO SOME OTHER THREE STRIKERS ABOUT THIS
THE OTHER KIDS WOULD LAUGH AT HIM
ONLY TO REALIZE YOU MAY NOT BE CAPABLE OF CONNECTING WITH ANOTHER PERSON ON THE LEVEL YOU WISH YOU COULD AND YET STILL SEARCHING
AND
YOU KNOW PART OF ME I WANTED TO SAVE HER
YOU KNOW
EVEN THOUGH THAT I WAS OUT OF CONTROL AND
ABOUT HAVING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER
AND IT WILL COME UP WHEN IT'S SUPPOSED TO COME UP THERE'S NO RIGHT OR WRONG WAY TO GRIEVE
AND THEN
BUT I'M NOT ACTUALLY SURE I DO KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT
THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT
LIKE WE SAID AT THE TOP WE'RE BETWEEN SEASONS
YES IT FELT LIKE HE WAS GIVING ME A HUG AND ALSO I THINK
WAS VERY HARD TO FIND HIS PLACE
REALLY
BUT I DON'T WANT HIM TO KNOW THAT WE'RE LEAVING
MY SISTER IN TEARS SMILED AND SAID NO HE'S JUST BEING A PAIN IN THE ASS ON PURPOSE
OR GOT SOMETHING OUT OF OUR EPISODE
GET OUT OF THIS RELATIONSHIP
OR WHO'S GENDER YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
GOD HOW DO I DESCRIBE
YOU KNOW THAT'S ALSO WHEN I THINK GOD I SHOULD JUST LIVE IN NEW YORK
KIND OF THAT
AND HE WAS IN OUR WEDDING
HUMAN SPEAKING ENTITY IN THE SKY I DON'T I DON'T BUY THAT BUT TO ME THAT IS LOVE WHEN I HEAR THE WORD GOD
HE'D THEN BUST THE DOOR DOWN AND STAND IN THE DOORWAY SCREAMING SO LOUDLY THAT I'D FEEL HIS SPIT SPRAYING ACROSS THE ROOM
I WALK OVER TO HER EXCUSE ME MA'AM I SAY ARE YOU RETA
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE STEALING YOUR FATHER'S SOCKS YOU HAVE TOO MANY SOCKS LET'S COUNT THESE SOCKS
AND SO
BUT
WORLD JUNIOR CHAMPION
WOW
EVEN BY MY PARENTS
AND I FELT LIKE A TERRIBLE MOTHER I WOULD GO TO THE PLAYGROUND AND BE SURROUNDED BY HAPPY EARTH MOTHERS WHO GUSHED WITH LOVE AND HAPPINESS AND HAND-PREPARED ORGANIC BABY FOOD
AND THAT'S KIND OF LIKE WHERE IT'S AT FOR ME
YOU KNOW THIS TOUGH HOCKEY PLAYER BUT
UM
AND
HER OTHER STRUGGLES I FEEL LIKE MY LIFE IS A CLOGGED TOILET THAT JUST WON'T STOP FLUSHING
I THINK THAT NOT MUCH GOES THROUGH MY HEAD AT THAT POINT
WHEN TYLER CLEARED OUT ALL THAT PAPERWORK FROM JOHN'S HOUSE IN THE DAYS RIGHT AFTER HE DIED
HIS DAD DIED WHEN HE WAS EIGHTEEN
I COULD SAY ABOUT WHAT BUT LET'S JUST LEAVE IT AT I WORRY
UM
THIS IS
UM AH
THE AMAZING PART IS THE FACT THAT
I WAS ALSO MOVED
BECAUSE YOU'RE SEEKING
I'M ALSO RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING THAT YOU PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT ME BY EMAIL OR PHONE UNQUOTE SO THAT ENDED THAT YEP

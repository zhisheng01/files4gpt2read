IT'S EASIER TO JUST WRITE A NOTE AND THEN PUT IT INSIDE A LITTLE CURRENT
WOW
I'LL TAKE DOWN A GENRE
E LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW SEX OFFENDERS AT SAN QUENTIN KEEP THEMSELVES SAFE WELL
THE GOAL I SET FOR MYSELF WAS NOT TO MAKE IT OUT ALIVE
THAT WAS WHEN MY MOM CAUGHT ME AND NEVER GOT ME HELP JUST THREATENED TO SEND ME AWAY IF I KEPT IT UP
AS I'M ADDRESSING IT YET AGAIN
AND SHE SAYS NO
SO WE ACTUALLY DID SOME FACT-CHECKING
HE USES A POLICE SCANNER APP ON HIS PHONE TO KEEP AN EAR OUT FOR COPS WHILE HE'S THERE
I JUST WANT MY DAD
THE SECOND SUPPORT GROUP I GOT INTO COMPLETELY CHANGED HOW I FELT ABOUT THAT
AND
IT HAS HELPED ME NOT TO FIND IT SO ALIEN TO HEAR SWEARING AND IT NO LONGER BOTHERS ME ANYWHERE NEAR AS MUCH TO HEAR PEOPLE SWEAR
WHEN WE COME BACK
ONE DAY WE WERE DRIVING TO TOWN TOGETHER TO GO HAVE DINNER AND SHE PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THE MUSIC SO I STARTED BLASTING SUBLIME'S CARESS ME DOWN
I'VE READ DOZENS OF SURVEYS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD PANIC ATTACKS IN GROCERY STORES
AND
I'D LIKE TO TELL A BOY WHO I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PLEASURE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM IF I'D HAD MORE COURAGE AND TIME TO DO SO
YOU OPEN THE FRONT DOOR AND THEY'RE LIKE
YOU KNOW
I HOPE YOU ARE TALKING TO A THERAPIST ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THAT IS A GREAT PLACE TO START TALKING ABOUT THAT FEELING OF OBLIGATION AND DREAD AND BEING OVERPOWERED
I FELT I'D FAILED I WOKE UP FROM A BLACKOUT AND RAN TO THE BATHROOM TO RELIEVE MYSELF ONLY TO BLACKOUT AGAIN
AND THE OTHER THING IS
I WON'T FREEZE AND CRY
I'M GOING THROUGH A LOT RIGHT NOW AND I'M THANKFUL FOR GETTING IN TOUCH WITH MY TRUE FEELINGS
IF MY LITTLE SISTERS DON'T EAT
THE PROJECTING INTO THE FUTURE AND THE OBSESSING ABOUT THE PAST AND TO JUST SEE ALL OF THE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE THINGS THAT WE'RE MISSING EVERY DAY BECAUSE WE GOT A FURROWED BROW AND WE'RE LOOKING INTO OUR BROKEN CRYSTAL BALL
YOU KNOW
UM
AND THAT WHAT WAS BEST FOR MY SON WAS AND IS A HEALED FATHER
ANOTHER ONE
MADE ME FEEL WORTHLESS MY WHOLE LIFE EVEN NOW I HATE MYSELF
AND
LIKE A JAPANESE RIDDLE LIKE WHAT IS THE SOUND OF SILENCE
YOU KNOW HENRI HENRI WON TEN STANLEY CUPS LIKE
THREE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS CAME OVER THAT MORNING ONE BY ONE TO LOVE ON ME IN MY TIME OF DESPAIR
IN GENERAL
DO YOU TAKE ANYTHING NOW NOTHING
HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM MY SELF HARM WAS
SO RARE
THERE ARE FIFTEEN NAMES AND PHONE NUMBERS ON THE LIST
I WISH WE HAD GROUP RIGHT NOW GOD DAMN IT
I ALWAYS KNEW THAT IT EXISTED IN THE WORLD BUT UNTIL I STARTED DOING THIS SHOW
SHE'S STRAIGHT IN HER THIRTY S RAISED IN A TOTALLY CHAOTIC ENVIRONMENT
NOT EVEN WHEN I BROUGHT A BRICK HOME AND REFUSED TO BATHE WITHOUT IT BY MY SIDE
THE STORY I WAS GOING TO SAY IS THAT
WHO KNOWS
THIS IS FILLED OUT BY A PERSON WHO CALLS THEMSELVES I BELIEVE IT'S A GUY
YOU KNOW
FUCK YOU AND DROP DEAD IN FRONT OF A BUS
WELL
THAT SHIT CAN'T BE PUT ON HOLD PUN INTENDED
THERE'S ONE IN PARTICULAR WHERE I EVEN CAUGHT HIM TELLING ME A FAKE NAME AND I DIDN'T CARE BECAUSE I WANTED SO BADLY TO BE OUT OF MYSELF
MESSAGES
ABOUT
WELL THE THING IS I WAS IN LOCKDOWN SO I WAS IN JAIL
HE HAD A REALLY SICK SENSE OF HUMOR AT THE TIME I WAS MADE TO FEEL THAT I WAS NEVER GOOD ENOUGH THAT I WAS WEAK AND A LOSER
SHE'S HAVING SOME DEPRESSION AND THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE HER IN FOR SOME THERAPY AND POSSIBLY MEDS ALL OF WHICH I'VE DONE MYSELF SO I WAS SAYING ENCOURAGING THINGS ABOUT THAT PROCESS
AND THEN SAY
AH SINGING FOR A FEW COINS SEASON ONE LISTENERS MIGHT REMEMBER THAT VOICE
THIS DEPRESSION FEELING
THAT WAS
SO
BASELINE DON'T WANT TO HAVE NEEDS AT ALL
GO WATCH THAT DOCUMENTARY RUNNING FROM CRAZY IT OH
HE HAD BLOCKED ME FROM SEEING HIS PROFILE
AND
IT'S NOT HAPPENING
I REALLY ENJOYED MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE GUYS ON JOHN'S LIST
THEY WERE PREPPY
GET OVER THERE
ELIJAH HAS BEEN LOCKED UP SINCE HE WAS SEVENTEEN
I THINK THE ONLY WAY TO SOOTHE MYSELF IS READING MORE SURVEYS
I KNEW IN THAT MOMENT THAT MY MOTHER LACKED AN ABILITY TO FACE DIFFICULT EMOTIONS AND I LEARNED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT I WAS ABLE TO FACE THEM
BOOSTING THEIR SELF-ESTEEM NOT SURE IF THIS COUNTS THOUGH
ZIPRECRUITER'S WEB SITE ALSO SHOWS TRENDING CAREER FIELDS
THEY SHOW ME GOOGLE MAPS SATELLITE IMAGES OF JOHN'S YARD WITH THE BUSES AND TRAILER IN THEM
AND THEN I WAS LIKE SO WHAT
YOU KNOW AWARD HER CUSTODY
THE FEW FIGHTS THAT I'VE GOTTEN IN IN HOCKEY
WHEN THEY WOULD WRITE A JOKE IN THAT THEY KNEW WAS TOO EDGY FOR THE CENSORS
I'M NOT PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT IT
DAUGHTER
I STARTED TO START HAVING FEELINGS AND DESIRES TO SWERVE MY LITTLE CAR UNDERNEATH THE TRACTOR-TRAILER ON THE HIGHWAY AND I WAS FRIGHTENED BY HOW MUCH I DID NOT FEEL OR CARE HOW MUCH THIS WOULD HURT MY LOVED ONES EVEN WHEN I KNEW IT WAS NOT A SOLUTION
I BELIEVE THIS STATEMENT SAYS IT ALL IT TOOK ME MONTHS TO DEVELOP A LOVING BOND WITH MY BABIES
TRY TO THINK OF SOMETHING FIVE YEARS AGO THAT WAS SUPER IMPORTANT THAT
AND
STAFF WERE PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY PEOPLE GOING FROM THE OUTSIDE IN BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED
I GOTTA SAY THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFICIENT USES OF SPACE
ADOLESCENCE YEAH
AND TRULY BELIEVE THAT
FORGET EVEN JUST THE EMOTIONAL
UM
AND SHE WRITES
AND SHE WRITES
IS GONE
I THINK I'VE SAID IT BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST
YOU GET IT AT HOTELS OH MR FRASER
HOW PEOPLE WHO DON'T PAY THEIR TV LICENSE GETS SENT TO THIS SHITHOLE

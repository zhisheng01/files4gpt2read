RIGHT
AND IN A NORMAL DAY I CAN'T STAND THE WIND
TWO THINGS THEY CARRY THAT I LOVE I GOT THE
YOU KNOW PAUL BAXTER WAS MY COACH AT THE TIME AND HE WAS YOU KNOW A REALLY SORT OF TOUGH YOU KNOW
AT LEAST THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY SAY TO ME
WHEN HE GAVE IT TO ME HE SAID IF I WAS EVER TO GET PREGNANT HE WOULD SHOOT ME IN THE FACE WITH A SHOTGUN
YOU KNOW STARTED DEALING WITH YOU KNOW
NEVA'
ALLEN TOLD ME SOMETHING I HADN'T KNOWN ABOUT JOHN
INSTEAD JOHN WRITES
THIS HAS BEEN TRICKY TERRITORY FOR US AND NO DOUBT FOR OUR LISTENERS
FLOGGING BOILING BURNING HAND-CUTTING HANGING EVISCERATION HONOR KILLINGS GANG RAPE
ELIJAH STARTED TO IDENTIFY AS GAY
BUT HARD TIMES FOR CURTIS BEGAN LONG BEFORE HE GOT TO PRISON GROWING UP MY FAMILY HAD A LOT OF ISSUES
SO THEY LET ME WEAR IT
STORED IT NEVER CHARGED US A PENNY AND MY BROTHER PAID WHAT HE PAID US
EVERY SO OFTEN THE SKY LIT UP WITH LIGHTNING
EVERY NIGHT HE DROVE BACK TO HIS PARENTS' HOUSE
WOW
THEN I GOT A TEXT THAT WE HAD TO PICK UP MY DAUGHTER AT THE END OF THE PARADE ROUTE WHICH WAS TWO MILES FROM OUR CHAIRS
IT MADE ME WANT TO BE VEGAN
AND SHE WRITES I RECENTLY LEFT AN EMOTIONALLY ABUSIVE HOME FOR COLLEGE LAST NIGHT I WALKED OUT OF THE THEATRE AFTER A SPOKEN WORD POETRY PERFORMANCE BY ONE OF MY FAVORITE POETS
THAT IS THE SPACE WHERE I WOULD HAVE INCLUDED AN INAPPROPRIATE JOKE BUT I JUST WANTED THERE TO BE SILENCE
MY HUSBAND AND I WENT TO COLLEGE WITH HIM AND HIS WIFE
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
SELF-SABOTAGE AND MANY MORE
OTHER TIMES AFTER AN ARGUMENT SHE WOULD COME TO MY ROOM WHILE I WAS ASLEEP AND SIT ON THE EDGE OF MY BED NEVER SPEAKING
IS THIS ISN'T ABOUT BLAME THIS IS ABOUT YOU NO LONGER MINIMIZING HOW MUCH IT HURT YOU
MEANS TAKING RISKS AND BEING VULNERABLE AND WORKING THROUGH THE PAIN THAT WE'VE BURIED
SEEING IT AND FEELING GUILTY AND ANXIOUS FOR WASTING IT
CRAFTY WRITES ABOUT HER DEPRESSION
AND RETA THINKS ON IT FOR A MOMENT AND THEN TELLS ME
AND ABOUT HOW MUCH FUN SHE HAD
THANKS FOR LISTENING
MY BOYFRIEND RECENTLY FOUND OUT THAT I WAS TALKING TO THIS OTHER PERSON AND HE WAS VERY UPSET WITH ME
GOOD FOR YOU WHAT AN AWESOME AWESOME BOUNDARY
YES
YOU DID NOT HAVE TO LEND YOUR MOTHER MONEY
I DO I LOSE SLEEP OVER
YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY NICE THOUGH IS WHEN YOU STOP FIGHTING THE FACT THAT YOU'RE A MESS
EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS MY HEADSHOT UP IN HER OFFICE AND BRAGS TO HER COWORKERS ABOUT ME WHENEVER I'M ON TV
AFTER THAT HAPPENED TO YOU DID YOU NOTICE A CHANGE IN YOUR OWN BEHAVIOR
I FELT SO GOD DAMNED ALIVE
ON AND ON THE ACCUSATIONS FLY
REAL FRIENDS THAT JUST GIVE A SHIT I WISH FOR A BETTER FAMILY RELATIONSHIP
GETTING IN MY BODY GETTING QUIET YOU KNOW MEDITATION ALL OF THAT
GETTING A COMPASS AND
NOW I FIND MYSELF HAVING A HARD TIME HAVING A DECENT RELATIONSHIP WITH PARTNERS OR FRIENDS
IT WAS AT HOME THOUGH
WHILST I WAS WAITING FOR HIM TO COLLECT ME FROM THE SHOPPING CENTER I NOTICED A POSTER ADVERTISING THAT YOU COULD WIN A SHOP SPACE WITH FREE RENT FOR A MONTH
THAT WAS THE MOST HELPFUL IN COPING WITH LIFE THE WAY MY BRAIN ADDRESSES LIFE ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS
SO I'VE KIND OF APPROACHED THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GET PARALYZED BY TOO MUCH
DEALS WITH DEPRESSION ANXIETY BULIMIA
YOU KNOW I HAD NOBODY SO I THOUGHT OK GREAT
AND THEN MY BRAIN JUST FILLED WITH GARBAGE AND THEN I WAS JUST LIKE THAT FAST JUST BACK INTO LIKE OBSESSIVE CRAZY
AND HE SAID SOMETHING VERY PROFOUND HE SAID
AND IT BEING EITHER A DIFFERENT MOM
AND YOUR PEACE HAS TO BE SORT OF REAL LIFE UNLESS I WANT TO BE A BUDDHIST NUN
ALRIGHT
I WAS ABUSED
ABOUT HIS LOVE ADDICTION OUR FIRST DATE ISN'T UNTIL NEXT WEEK BUT I'M ALREADY PLANNING OUR WEDDING
TO QUOTE
YOUR MOM TRYING TO HELP BY CALLING YOU A STUPID PIECE OF SHIT
AND THE GRASS WAS BROWN
SHE WAS ALWAYS GETTING DRUNK AND MY DAD WOULD ALWAYS JUST LEAVE HE LEFT ME AND MY SISTER IN THE HOUSE ALONE WITH OUR DRUNK MOTHER AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FORGIVE HIM
SO THAT'S
YOU MIX IT UP WITH A DAB OF LITTLE GREASE
DO NOT BEAT YOURSELF UP ABOUT THAT MAN
AND I WAS GONNA KICK THE HELMET RIGHT BACK AT THEO
WHAT ABOUT AN APOLOGY
WELL THE SOCIAL MEDIA I FOUND HIM ON WAS A GAY FUCK APP
EVERY TIME HE KIND OF LOOKS AT ME
AND NOT TO WORRY
AND OF LADY GAGA GETTING VOMITED UPON BY A SO-CALLED VOMIT ARTIST
MAYBE I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO TRULY RELAX AGAIN ON A SUNNY DAY
ONLINE THERAPY
AND YOU NEED TO TALK TO SOMEBODY
BECAUSE NONE OF IT FUCKING MATTERS ANYWAY
YOU KNOW PURGING IN GAS STATIONS
SO CHILDHOOD
I FELT SO GUILTY THAT HIS PARENTS MIGHT THINK HE HIT ME FROM ALL THE BRUISES SO I TRIED TO HIDE MY FACE FROM THEM FOR A WEEK
WE WELCOME YOU
SO HE HAS MORE THAN ONE PENIS
I JUST CAN'T MAKE MYSELF LET GO OF THE THINGS THEY'VE SAID DONE AND HELPED TO INTERNALIZE WITHIN ME THAT I'M NOW HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME UNLEARNING
AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK THINGS CAN AND SHOULD CHANGE AND SO WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM
LIKE WITH OTHERS TOM SAYS THE TOWN CLERK FAYE DID CALL HIM ABOUT JOHN SUICIDE
I GET REALLY TURNED ON BY ACTION MOVIES
EVEN THOUGH I STRUGGLED IN THE MIDDLE PART OF MY LIFE WITH
KERRY HE WAS TALKING ABOUT MY DRUG PROBLEMS THEO SAID
THERE
IT DOESN'T GET WORSE THAN THAT IN MY OPINION AND I WOULD AGREE
EVER BEEN THE VICTIM OF SEXUAL ABUSE SOME STUFF HAPPENED BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT COUNTS
I MEAN I JUST HAD SO MANY QUESTIONS HERE'S OUR CONVERSATION WITH DEL DID THEY TAKE YOUR HUSBAND AWAY THEY DIDN'T TAKE HIM AWAY THEY TOOK HIS COMPUTER
HEY KID
YOU KNOW I WAS JUST LIVING LIFE I I WAS TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST OUT OF BEING IN PRISON HE GOT OFF DRUGS AND HE STARTED TAKING HIS HEALTH AND HIS MENTAL HEALTH
IT WAS JUST A SAD BUT SWEET MEMORY
SHE WAS I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE WAS TAKING OUT ON ME BUT
I FINALLY HAD THE CHANCE ONE NIGHT TO CUDDLE WITH HER ALONE WHEN I COULDN'T SLEEP DUE TO INSOMNIA
AND THEN SHE WRITES FULL DISCLOSURE I'M SIS
THEN HELD AND CARESSED BY MY ATTACKER

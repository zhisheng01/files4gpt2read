1701.THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT AND YOU KNOW WHY I WANTED TO END WITH THAT
1702.WOW THAT IS A GOOD ONE
1703.HOLY SHIT
1704.NO I SAID
1705.I RAN OUT OF MY BEDROOM GRABBED TWO HANDFULS OF ICE CUBES FROM THE FREEZER AND BEGAN RUBBING THEM ON MY FACE STOMACH AND LEGS
1706.FILL THOSE OUT MORE
1707.HE IS
1708.ECHO
1709.YOU KNOW RELATIONSHIPS ARE REALLY HARD FOR US AFTER TRAUMA
1710.SO
1711.ALRIGHT CONTINUING
1712.UM
1713.NEXT TIME ON EAR HUSTLE MY CELLIE T WAS A GUY WHO WAS A PROLIFIC RUNNER AND AN EXERCISER
1714.HE SAID QUOTE
1715.AT LEAST NOT ANYTIME SOON
1716.AND THERE'S A LOT OF DEDICATION THAT HAS TO HAPPEN IN ORDER FOR YOU TO ACCOMPLISH THAT
1717.OR DONATIONS LATELY AND
1718.THE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE WAS NOT GOOD
1719.CURTAIN STAGE WHERE YOU CAN'T SEE IT
1720.IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A SWITCH WENT OFF
1721.MY OPINION THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOUR
1722.DR JONICE WEBB J O N I C E
1723.BUT
1724.I'VE TRIED TO TALK TO MY WIFE ABOUT IT
1725.BUT THEN I'LL KEEP DELAYING THE COURT CASE BY FILING MOTIONS
1726.SNAPSHOT FROM THEIR LIFE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I OFTEN FELT PHYSICALLY EMPTY AND LIKE I WAS FLOATING
1727.BUT I HAD THAT FEELING WHICH IS
1728.BECAUSE SHE KNOWS FOR SURE SOME OTHER THINGS HAD DISAPPEARED BY THEN THINGS
1729.I GUESS THERE'S A HUSTLE FOR EVERYTHING
1730.I'M TERRIFIED OF DYING AND ITS CONSEQUENCES
1731.AND THAT'S JUST KIND OF WHERE I'M AT RIGHT NOW AND I GUESS IT HELPS KNOWING THAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH THAT BEFORE AND COME OUT OF IT BUT WHEN I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF IT
1732.CURTIS SAID HE'LL BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE WHEN HE'S SERVED FIFTY YEARS
1733.BUT I HAVE A LITTLE FUNNY CAT AND HE ALWAYS I GET IN BED I PUT THE COVERS OVER ME
1734.I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYONE I FEEL AWFUL I ALSO CAN'T STOP WORRYING THAT SOMETHING HORRIBLE WILL HAPPEN TO MY DAUGHTER AND IT WOULD BE THE END OF ME I REMIND HER ALL THE TIME THAT SHE'S IN CONTROL OF HERSELF AND TO BE OPEN
1735.AND NOW HE UNFORTUNATELY SAYS THE SAME
1736.IT IS NOT YOUR CHOICE TO HANG ON TO IT THAT IS THERE BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT TRAUMA DOES AND SO DO NOT SHAME YOURSELF FOR STILL HAVING THOSE FEELINGS
1737.IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING
1738.BEAUTIFUL MOMENT THAT
1739.THEY'RE GONNA ADMIT YOU THEY'LL BE WAITING OUT FRONT
1740.I ACCEPT BOTH OF THOSE
1741.BIG-HEARTED
1742.TO PROTECT HIS IDENTITY WE CAN'T REVEAL TOO MANY DETAILS ABOUT WHEN AND WHERE
1743.EVEN IF THAT PERSON ISN'T
1744.WHOLENESS IS WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE STRIVING FOR
1745.AND IF WE DON'T EXPRESS THE SADNESS
1746.THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THAT FOR SOMEBODY AND AND YOU KNOW
1747.HEY MOM AND DAD
1748.THIS IS
1749.LIKE I WAS EXACTLY WHERE I BELONG
1750.THE SUBJECT LINE SAYS I WANT TO COME TO YOU FROM RUSSIA YOU DO NOT MIND
1751.YOU LITTLE SHITBAG ASSHOLE
1752.SHE HAD A FLASHBACK OF HER BOYFRIEND TRYING TO STRANGLE HER
1753.SHE TOLD ME THAT IF I WAS GOING TO KEEP QUOTE BEING LIKE THIS THEN SHE WASN'T COMFORTABLE LETTING ME GO TO COLLEGE IN THE FALL HER ANGER MADE MY SYMPTOMS WORSE AND SHE LEFT ME ALONE IN THE HOUSE
1754.BECAUSE OF THE LOCKDOWN GUYS AREN'T WORKING RIGHT NOW SO THEY AREN'T GETTING THAT SMALL BIT OF MONEY THAT HELPS THEM BUY FOOD AT CANTEEN AND INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE CHOW HALL THEY'RE GETTING FOOD DELIVERED TO THEIR CELLS IN BOXES
1755.IS AS POWERFUL A PART OF THE FANTASY AS THE
1756.FEEL OR HAVE FELT LIKE YOU DO
1757.SO THAT IS NO REFLECTION ON YOU AS A PERSON SO STOP BEATING YOURSELF UP ABOUT THAT
1758.SO THEN YOU CAN GRAB ONTO SOMEBODY ELSE'S LINE
1759.LIKE IF SOMETHING'S GOING TO GO DOWN I'M GOING TO RUN AWAY OR I'M GOING TO PREPARE MYSELF FOR IT IN SOME WAY
1760.FUCKING EXPLORE IT YOU KNOW
1761.YOU CAN HELP BY TRYING TO GET SOMETHING PUT IN
1762.THESE FIRST SEVEN NAMES AT THE TOP
1763.I REMEMBER WE WERE IN DENVER
1764.TO EVERYDAY COMPULSIVE NEGATIVE THINKING
1765.NORMALLY I'M NOT VERY EMOTIONALLY OPEN WITH MY FRIENDS THERE HAVE BEEN EXCEPTIONS BUT THAT'S MY DEFAULT BUT SINCE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT DEPRESSION AND STUFF
1766.ACTUALLY WE DID A LITTLE WHILE AGO I THINK IT WAS MAYBE SIX MONTHS AGO WITH UM
1767.YES
1768.JAW-DROPPING
1769.MY THERAPIST AND I DISCUSSED GRIPPING ICE CUBES WHENEVER I FEEL THE NEED TO PUNISH MYSELF OR TO USE THE ICE AS A COPING SKILL WHEN I BECOME OVERHEATED OR PANICKED
1770.THIS KEEPS COMING BACK
1771.AMEN AMEN ABSOLUTELY THANKS GUYS THANK YOU
1772.HE BROKE UP WITH ME HIS ROOMMATE CAME IN THE ROOM I WAS STAYING IN AND HAD SEX WITH ME
1773.AND
1774.HOW DO YOU FEEL AFTER WRITING THESE THINGS DOWN LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO RECOGNIZE BITS AND PIECES OF MY STORY FROM OTHER SURVEYS I'VE FILLED OUT HA HA
1775.HOW DOES SHE
1776.WHERE I SPENT ALL MY TIME ASLEEP I THEN SPENT A WEEK IN A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL I WAS VEGAN AT THE TIME
1777.FEELING GUILTY AND ANXIOUS BUT STILL BEING TOO TIRED AND HOPELESS TO GET OUT OF BED OR OFF THE COUCH TO GO OUTSIDE AND ENJOY IT
1778.THEIR GANGS HAVE TIGHT POWER STRUCTURES
1779.I HOPE
1780.THE WIND LEFT MY LUNGS AND THE ONLY THING I REMEMBER THINKING IS PERFECT LOVE CASTS OUT FEAR AND THAT MY BODY LITERALLY WILLED ITSELF TO LIFE AS I VOWED TO FIGURE OUT
1781.I THINK IT FUELED MY FANTASIES ABOUT BEING SEXUALLY SUBMISSIVE TO SOMEONE
1782.GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE OKAY
1783.AS FOR THE QUESTION OF JOHN'S ASSETS
1784.YOU CAN ACTUALLY BLACK OUT IN RAGE
1785.KIND OF REMINDS ME OF THE
1786.WHAT WOULD IT HAVE BEEN AT
1787.YEAH YOUR MOM IS AH

1790.I SKATED OUT AT THE START OF THE SECOND PERIOD
1791.I THINK THAT'S THE COOLEST THING ABOUT BEING A MOM IN RECOVERY IS TO HAVE A CLUE WHAT THE HANDBOOK TO LIFE IS AND ACTUALLY BE TEACHING SOME OF THAT STUFF
1792.YOU KNOW SEE HIM AROUND KIDS AND COACHING KIDS AND SO HE
1793.AND A USELESS FUCKFACE
1794.MAKE SURE I GOT OUT OF THE DOOR ON TIME AND JUST BE WITH ME

1797.AND I APOLOGIZED
1798.YEAH
1799.YOU COULD TELL HE WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED
1800.IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PURGE AND THEN IT'S A CRASH OR FOR YOU IS IT RIGHT AFTER THE PURGE IT'S IMMEDIATE CRASH

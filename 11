1105.I GUESS IT'S A UNIVERSAL THING TO SAY OR ASK FOR ME BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S SO WRONG WITH ME I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I ALWAYS COME IN LAST
1106.AND
1107.SUICIDE FROM THAT POINT WAS A VERY EASY STEP
1108.I WANT YOU TO COME IF YOU DO NOT MIND WRITE ME
1109.SO I DROVE UP THERE AT LIKE TWENTY OR SOMETHING EVERYONE WAS THERE FROM LIKE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES FOR AN ENTIRE SESSION LIKE
1110.LIKE DANIEL AND ALIJAH WE'VE ALTERED HER VOICE

1112.BY YOUR FAMILY OF ORIGIN
1113.THAT IS A T-SHIRT
1114.SO DOES ALL THOSE MENTAL
1115.AND I WENT TO BED
1116.MY JOB WAS TO STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TRACK ON A DIRT MOUND AND FLIP THE CARS WHEN THEY LANDED ON THEIR BACKS
1117.I SPIED A LITTLE SOMETHING ON THE STREET
1118.HE HASN'T HEARD IT YET
1119.A WHOLE LOT OF AWFULSOME
1120.HE'S IN HIS EARLY FORTIES NOW
1121.A DAY OR SO AFTER FINDING HIM AND PROCESSING WHAT ALL THIS MEANT I SENT HIM A MESSAGE ON THE APP
1122.IT'S MASSIVE IT'S GOT A GIANT CASTLE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT RIGHT SITTIN' ON TOP OF A PYRAMID
1123.I THINK YOU ARE WHAT YOU PRACTICE I DON'T PRACTICE SEXUAL DEVIANCE ANYMORE
1124.I WANTED I DIDN'T WANT TO QUIT I JUST WANTED I WANTED TO GET BETTER
1125.PROMPTLY FOLLOWED WITH TOOTSEE ROLL BY SIXTY NINE BOYZ
1126.I WAS ABLE TO SEE PAST THIS ASSHOLE I KNEW I COULD FIND A BETTER SHRINK OUTSIDE OF THIS PLACE AND I DID
1127.SHE TOLD THE POLICE OFFICERS THAT JOHN HAD SAID THERE WAS GOLD THERE
1128.I REALIZED RIGHT THEN THAT ALL THE DREAMS I EVER HAD OF MATTERING TO HIM AND BEING DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL WERE JUST NOT EVER GOING TO BE REALITY
1129.FATIMA I
1130.WHERE PEOPLE ARE
1131.QUICKLY SCREEN CANDIDATES RATE THEM AND HIRE THE RIGHT PERSON FAST IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES
1132.BUT AT THE TIME I WAS JUST FROZEN
1133.HOW JOHN GOT IN TOUCH WITH OUR RADIO SHOW AND THEN I STARTED INVESTIGATING SOME LOCAL GOINGS-ON WITH HIM
1134.VULNERABILITY IS ALWAYS THE KEY
1135.I'M ON MEDICATION FOR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION BUT SHE REFUSES TO SEEK HELP OF ANY KIND
1136.YOU KNOW
1137.I REMEMBER IT LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY EVEN THOUGH IT WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO
1138.DISBELIEF THAT IT WAS REALLY OVER AND THAT I NO LONGER HAD ANYTHING TO FEAR OR DREAD
1139.ANY POSITIVE EXPERIENCES
1140.RAHSAAN'S CELLMATE TESTED POSITIVE
1141.YOU KNOW ROLLING HILLS TALL TREES
1142.OH AND THEN THERE'S SOME MORE NOTE DUE TO MIX UP OF SOME NUMBERS AND NAMES WE ASK THAT YOU KEEP YOUR WINNING INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL UNTIL YOUR CLAIM HAS BEEN PROCESSED AND YOUR MONEY REMITTED TO YOU
1143.FIGURING OUT TECHNIQUES HE COULD USE IN HIS CLOCK RESTORATIONS
1144.THAT WHAT I'M REALLY DOING IS
1145.WHAT I HEAR A RASPY TASTE
1146.I HATE IT AND DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT AT THE SAME TIME I ALSO FANTASIZE ABOUT MY EX WITH A PLEASANT PENIS COMING ALL OVER ME AND IN MY MOUTH THIS MAKES ME FEEL MORE NORMAL BUT STILL UPSET THAT I CAN'T MOVE PAST HIM
1147.THEO HAD JUST GOTTEN BACK TO THE ICE AFTER SOME TIME IN A REHAB PROGRAM AT THE TIME
1148.I OFTEN DRAG MYSELF THROUGH THE DAY COUNTING THE MINUTES UNTIL I CAN GO HOME AND LAY DOWN AGAIN
1149.NEUTRAL LANGUAGE
1150.THEN J GAVE CHRISTIANA A BIG BOX WITH DIARIES OF THE FIRST THREE YEARS AND THEN WHEN SHE'S THE DIARIES WHEN SHE HAS STAYED UP ALL NIGHT READING THESE DIARIES AS MUCH AS SHE COULD
1151.SO I CARRY THAT VOICE WHAT WAS IT ABOUT ME
1152.LIKE I STOOD THERE FOR PROBABLY TEN MINUTES LOOKING AT THIS AISLE THINKING
1153.INSTEAD OF YELLING FROM
1154.BECAUSE I WAS TALKING TO MY DAD

1167.THEY SAID OKAY I'M WITH YOU
1168.SEEING HOW MUCH I AM MAKING HER HAND HURT AND KNOWING THERE IS SO MUCH PAIN LEFT IN ME THAT I CANNOT CRUSH INTO HER HAND
1169.WEIRD
1170.HAVE YOU FELT JUDGED FOR STAYING WITH HIM OH YEAH THAT WAS THE OTHER HUGE JUDGMENT WHY DID YOU STAY WHY DO YOU STAY WHY DID YOU BAIL HIM OUT
1171.THE FIRST DAY WHICH WAS A THURSDAY MY APARTMENT BUILDING WAS OUT OF POWER FOR ALMOST TWENTY-FOUR HOURS AND I DIDN'T HAVE WATER
1172.SO YOU SAID THAT YOUR HUSBAND WAS JUST LOOKING HE WASN'T HE WASN'T TOUCHING ANY CHILDREN

1178.AND THERE'S NO SHAME IN IT
1179.OF THESE FRIENDS
1180.SHE DOES CONSIDER ME HER CHILD' BECAUSE I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE SHE TREATED ME LIKE ONE OF HER OWN
1181.I LOVE THAT TOO BECAUSE THAT'S LIKE
1182.BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAVE SHIT TO DO WITH ME
1183.BUT EVERYBODY IN THE LEAGUE KNEW THAT THEO HAD SPENT A FEW ROUGH YEARS STRUGGLING WITH DRUGS AND ALCOHOL
1184.YOU KNOW I JUST HAD THIS IMAGE IN MY HEAD THAT THAT IS THE LOVE THAT YOU WANTED
1185.IF YOU'VE BEEN TAKING A LOT OF BENZOS FOR A LONG TIME PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE

1194.GUILT THAT I DEPRIVED MY PARENTS OF A GRANDCHILD
1195.WHAT MY DREAMS WERE WHAT MY GOALS WERE AND WHAT MY ASPIRATIONS WERE AND HE WAS ACTUALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO ME
1196.YOU NAME IT
1197.AND THEN SHE LAUGHED AND SAID MAN I HATE THAT GUY HE IS SUCH A DOUCHE
1198.AND THE DECISION FOR HER WAS TO GO INTO MENTAL HOSPITALS AND THE DECISION FOR ME MY MOTHER DECIDED RATHER THAN SHAME HERSELF AND ADMIT TO BEING A SHIT MOTHER MAYBE RIGHT

1200.AND HE WRITES

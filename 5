501.IT'S EASIER TO JUST WRITE A NOTE AND THEN PUT IT INSIDE A LITTLE CURRENT
502.WOW
503.I'LL TAKE DOWN A GENRE
504.E LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW SEX OFFENDERS AT SAN QUENTIN KEEP THEMSELVES SAFE WELL
505.THE GOAL I SET FOR MYSELF WAS NOT TO MAKE IT OUT ALIVE
506.THAT WAS WHEN MY MOM CAUGHT ME AND NEVER GOT ME HELP JUST THREATENED TO SEND ME AWAY IF I KEPT IT UP
507.AS I'M ADDRESSING IT YET AGAIN
508.AND SHE SAYS NO
509.SO WE ACTUALLY DID SOME FACT-CHECKING
510.HE USES A POLICE SCANNER APP ON HIS PHONE TO KEEP AN EAR OUT FOR COPS WHILE HE'S THERE
511.I JUST WANT MY DAD
512.THE SECOND SUPPORT GROUP I GOT INTO COMPLETELY CHANGED HOW I FELT ABOUT THAT
513.AND
514.IT HAS HELPED ME NOT TO FIND IT SO ALIEN TO HEAR SWEARING AND IT NO LONGER BOTHERS ME ANYWHERE NEAR AS MUCH TO HEAR PEOPLE SWEAR
515.WHEN WE COME BACK
516.ONE DAY WE WERE DRIVING TO TOWN TOGETHER TO GO HAVE DINNER AND SHE PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THE MUSIC SO I STARTED BLASTING SUBLIME'S CARESS ME DOWN
517.I'VE READ DOZENS OF SURVEYS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD PANIC ATTACKS IN GROCERY STORES
518.AND
519.I'D LIKE TO TELL A BOY WHO I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PLEASURE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM IF I'D HAD MORE COURAGE AND TIME TO DO SO
520.YOU OPEN THE FRONT DOOR AND THEY'RE LIKE
521.YOU KNOW
522.I HOPE YOU ARE TALKING TO A THERAPIST ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THAT IS A GREAT PLACE TO START TALKING ABOUT THAT FEELING OF OBLIGATION AND DREAD AND BEING OVERPOWERED
523.I FELT I'D FAILED I WOKE UP FROM A BLACKOUT AND RAN TO THE BATHROOM TO RELIEVE MYSELF ONLY TO BLACKOUT AGAIN
524.AND THE OTHER THING IS
525.I WON'T FREEZE AND CRY
526.I'M GOING THROUGH A LOT RIGHT NOW AND I'M THANKFUL FOR GETTING IN TOUCH WITH MY TRUE FEELINGS
527.IF MY LITTLE SISTERS DON'T EAT
528.THE PROJECTING INTO THE FUTURE AND THE OBSESSING ABOUT THE PAST AND TO JUST SEE ALL OF THE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE THINGS THAT WE'RE MISSING EVERY DAY BECAUSE WE GOT A FURROWED BROW AND WE'RE LOOKING INTO OUR BROKEN CRYSTAL BALL
529.YOU KNOW
530.UM
531.AND THAT WHAT WAS BEST FOR MY SON WAS AND IS A HEALED FATHER
532.ANOTHER ONE
